## Part 2: How to Record Slack Meetings

All the text messages on Slack are backed up and can easily be searched and shared again. But, what if you start an audio or video Slack meeting? Until now, no feature enables you to record Slack meeting.

Therefore, to record Slack meeting for later use, you will have to use a third-party app like Zoom and integrate it with Slack.

Here is how you can record Slack meeting.

1.Click on the **Apps**tab on the left side menu. Click on **Add** **apps**.

![Add Slack Apps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-slack-apps.jpg)

2.Now, in the search bar, type and search **Zoom**. Click on the **Add** This will take you to the Slack App Directory.

![Slack App Directory](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-app-directory.jpg)

3.Tap on **Add** **to** **Slack**.

![Add To Slack](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-to-slack.jpg)

4.**Allow**Zoom to access your data and enable the app.

![Allow Zoom On Slack](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/allow-zoom-on-slack.jpg)

5.Now, go to your workspace and type the **"/zoom"**command in the chatbox. Tap on the **Zoom** meeting tab.

![Slack Zoom Chatbox](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-zoom-chatbox.jpg)

6.Click on **Authorize** **Zoom** and adjust the settings.

## Part 3: Slack Video Call Settings

Slack allows users to schedule a meeting with third-party apps or in Slack itself. You can just as easily have a Slack meeting using the in-built video call option.

You can either have a one-on-one video call in a DM chat or have a Slack meeting with 14 other participants through a channel video call. Either way, Slack has multiple video call settings to make your work and communication easier.

The settings tab in the video call enables you to create a name for the video call. There are also audio and video settings that can be changed to enhance the video call experience.

![Slack Video Call Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-video-call-settings.jpg)

Moreover, if you wish to stay on mute and still engage with the speaker, just click on the emoji on the screen. Select from a variety of reactions or type a text message right on the video screen.
