If that is not the case with you, you can use Windows Game Bar to capture screenshots and record gameplay in simple steps.

Step 2: Open LOL game on your computer and start playing the game. Press Windows + Alt + R keys together to start recording LOL gameplay.

Step 3: You can stop recording anytime by pressing Windows + Alt + R together again.

You can find the recorded video by going to Widgets and then to Gallery section.
