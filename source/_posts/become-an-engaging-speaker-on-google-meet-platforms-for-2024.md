## Part 4: How to Create a Private Chat on Google Meet?

Many individuals wonder if they can privately chat on Google Meet, however that option is not possible in the Google Meet chat feature till now.

However, all those present in the session while the message was sent can read it. There is no option to create a private chat on Google Meet as of now.
