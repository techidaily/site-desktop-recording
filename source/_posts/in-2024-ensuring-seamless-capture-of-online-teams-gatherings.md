**Q3) Will people know if I start a recording on Teams meeting?**

**A3)** Yes. If you are using the Teams’ built-in recording feature to record a meeting, all the attendees will be notified about it. If you don’t want anyone to know that you are recording a session, you can use an efficient third-party app like Wondershare Filmora, and follow the steps explained earlier to learn **how to record Teams meeting** behind the scenes.
