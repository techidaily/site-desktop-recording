## Part 3\. ShareX Alternatives

ShareX is not the ideal software to use if your intention is to record your screen. ShareX is the best screenshot capturing tool. Capturing screen video as well as webcam video involves complicated steps. Besides, it lacks necessary customizable settings for recording video as well as there is hardly any editing option for the recorded video.

Coming to the user interface, it is rather clumsy and not at all intuitive. Besides, ShareX Mac version is not available, and hence, the recorder is only suitable for Windows users. Considering all these drawbacks, it is better to opt for a better alternative. Here are the best ShareX alternatives you should definitely try out.

## Conclusion

ShareX is great if you want to capture screenshots of your current screen as well as record your screen. However, the settings are not highly customizable while recording and the lack of features is a huge concern if you want to record regularly. That is why we have recommended the best ShareX alternatives, and our top pick is Wondershare Filmora which is easy to use and feature-rich.
