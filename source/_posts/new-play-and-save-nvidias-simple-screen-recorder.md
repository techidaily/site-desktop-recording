**Instant Reply Mode** \- When you turn on Instant Replay mode on ShadowPlay, the software keeps recording your gameplay in the background. If you have pulled off an amazing move in your game, you can press the hotkey to save the last 30 seconds of recorded gameplay on your computer. Therefore, you do not need to save the entire recorded video file. Instead, you can save only the important scenes and thereby save a lot of space on your drive.

**Key Gaming Moments** \- With the screen recorder NVIDIA Highlights feature, the software automatically captures the key moments in your gameplay and saves them for you to review. You can have all the important highlights from your gameplay and share them on social media platforms instantly.

**Live Streaming** \- You can live stream your gameplay on Twitch, YouTube, and Facebook at very high quality without any lag. In fact, it supports external camera for personalization, and there are various graphics overlays available for customization.

Besides, users can create stunning screenshots at 8k resolution and upload them to social media platforms without leaving the game.

**Useful Hotkeys** \- Gamers always prefer screen recorders that allow shortcut keys and hotkeys to avail different features. NVIDIA comes with a bundle of hotkeys for the convenience of the users and uninterrupted gameplay.

**User Interface** \- NVIDIA ShadowPlay has an intuitive and user-friendly interface that users can operate without going through any tutorial. There are not many complicated options and steps required and this enhances the overall user experience as well as the speed of operation.

## Part 2\. How to Record Games NVIDIA Screen Recorder

NVIDIA ShadowPlay comes under NVIDIA GeForce recording option. This means you cannot open ShadowPlay directly, and you have to open it via GeForce Experience. Therefore, you need to have GeForce Experience installed on your phone. Apart from ShadowPlay, you get a direct game streaming option, instant game settings optimization and NVIDIA graphics card updates under GeForce Experience. Here are the steps to follow to use NVIDIA record screen software to record gameplay.

Step 1: Download and install GeForce Experience from NVIDIA official website. Launch GeForce Experience from Windows Start menu.

![run nvidia shadowplay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadowplay-overlay.jpg)

Step 2: Once GeForce Experience opens, you have to click on the Share button at the top-right corner. This will open NVIDIA Share toolbar at the top of the screen.

Step 3: Along with NVIDIA Share toolbar, you will see ShadowPlay overlay UI. There are mainly three options - Instant Replay, Record, and Broadcast.

![shadowplay record button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadowplay-record.jpg)

If you do not see the overlay containing recording options, click on the Share button at the left of the NVIDIA Share toolbar.

Step 4: Start the game whose gameplay you want to record. You will be asked to permit screen recording of the game.

Step 5: Turn on Instant Replay option to save epic moments during the gameplay. Finally, click on Record option and click on Start option to start recording.

![run shadowplay recorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/run-shadowplay-recorder.jpg)

Step 6: During the gameplay, you can get back NVIDIA ShadowPlay overlay by pressing Alt + Z. Top stop recording, go to Record option and click on Stop and Save option.

## Part 3\. Performance and Requirements

There have been concerns raised by professional gamers that when you use NVIDIA ShadowPlay to record gameplay or even broadcast gameplay live, it affects the performance of the game. After thorough experimentation, it has been found that running NVIDIA ShadowPlay to record gameplay or broadcast gameplay leads to the use of system resources. Therefore, there is a dip in the overall performance of the game of 5%-10%. Such a dip is negligible if you have a high-performance gaming computer.

However, the dip could be significant if your computer does not have a high configuration. In that case, the gameplay can get slightly slow and lag at times. In a fair comparison, NVIDIA GeForce recording may take slightly more system resources than most screen recording software. This means no matter which screen recorder you use, there will always be some dip in the performance of the game, and you should learn to neglect it.

NVIDIA record gameplay software is compatible with Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10\. It is not compatible with Linux or macOS. Here is the list of system requirements for NVIDIA ShadowPlay.

* RAM - 4GB or Higher.
* CPU - Intel Pentium G series, Intel Core i3 or higher.
* AMD FX, Ryzen 3 and higher.
* GPU - GeForce GTX 650 or Higher.
* Driver - GeForce 430.64 or later.
* Price - Free.
