A picture is worth a thousand words. That’s so true when you want to show somebody how to do something. While it is easy to capture the screen on your iPhone or Android phone, even in [Windows and Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), each of them provides a built-in screen capture feature. For Linux users, taking a shot of your screen on Ubuntu Linux does not need to be a complicated task, too.

Though there are many screen capture tools for Linux available on the market, to make things easier, consider the top 8 screen capture tools for Linux mentioned below. They are all excellent when it comes to user-friendliness, allowing you to take screenshots or record screens in a snap.

Some of these tools are only used to capture screenshots and edit the captured images, while some also allow you to capture the whole activity on your screen, namely, [record whatever happening on your Linux screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Hope it is helpful for you to find the best screen capture tool based on your needs.

Even if it is your first time using this screen shot tool, you will not experience any complication as it is built with the needs of users in mind.

Kazam is excellent because it offers versatility. If you do not want to record the entire screen, you will have the option to record only a selected area.

Many of those who have used such complained about the lack of webcam viewers. It is also not usable in all configurations.

![Screencaster ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Screencaster.jpg)
