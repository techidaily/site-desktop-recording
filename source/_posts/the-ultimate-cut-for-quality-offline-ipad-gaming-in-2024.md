There are many other features included in the app, in addition to the puzzles themselves. The Stats page allows you to track your streaks, and the archive will enable you to do puzzles from the past or buy special crossword packs.

A Crossword subscription can be purchased separately or as part of a New York Times Digital Subscription. The Mini crossword isn't nearly as fun as a full crossword, so you'll only be able to access it if you don't subscribe.

You can keep an unlimited amount of crosswords offline for later play, even if you don't have access to the Internet to download.

Taking it in turns and passing it to your friends in front of you is part of the game's Pass-and-Play mode, but it is also excellent as a solo game. The games are designed to keep you occupied on a real-life trip on the train, taking fifteen to twenty minutes each.
