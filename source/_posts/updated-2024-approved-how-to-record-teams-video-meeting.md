* Must be using Office 365 Enterprise with an E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Essentials, or Business Premium license
* Must have the recording feature turned on by the IT administrator of the organization
* Must not be a guest or attendee from another organization

### 1\. Record Teams Meeting on Desktop/Laptop

Once you are sure that all the prerequisites that are listed above are met, you can go through the following instructions to learn **how to record a Teams meeting** on a computer:

**Step 1: Start a Teams Video Call**

Launch Microsoft Teams on your PC (a Windows 10 laptop here). On the main interface, make sure that the **Chat** option is selected in the pane on the left. Then, click **Video** **Call** (the **Camcorder** icon) from the top-right area of the **Chat** pane.

**Step 2: Start the Recording**

During an ongoing meeting session, click the **More actions** icon from the top-right area of the **Meeting with** box, and click **Start recording** from the menu that comes down next to start the recording.

**Step 3: Stop the Recording**

Once the meeting session is over, you can open the **More actions** menu again, and click **Stop recording** this time to stop the recording.

### 2\. Record Teams Video Meeting on Smartphones

**Step 3: Enable Automatic Recording**

On the **Meeting options** page, turn on the **Record automatically** switch. Once this is done, you can safely share the invitation link with the people you want to attend the meeting, and Teams will start the recording as soon as the first participant joins in.
