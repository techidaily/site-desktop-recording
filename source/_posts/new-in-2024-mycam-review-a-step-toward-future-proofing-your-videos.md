## MyCam Review: A Step Toward Future-Proofing Your Videos

MyCam from E2ESoft is a simple application to capture your webcam videos as well as photos instantly. Apart from video and photo capturing, you can apply different effects to the videos as well as add filters to your photos. Using MyCam, you can broadcast to YouTube and Facebook as well. Besides, you can create shorts videos and GIFs which are quite popular on social media platforms.

MyCam for PC is available for free but it puts a watermark on your recorded video or captured photos. Therefore, you have to pay the price to purchase its license and get free of all its limitations. However, before your purchase its license, you must be questioning if MyCam is the best application out there for webcam recording. In this article, we will review MyCam screen recorder and recommend you a better alternative.
