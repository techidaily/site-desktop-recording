Citra is an easy-to-use Nintendo 3ds emulator for PC. Compared to the Nintendo console, this one has enhanced 3D graphics, which offer higher resolutions. Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS X, as well as Linux, provides full support for this program.

Citra was publicly launched as experimental software in 2015 as an open-source project. Using the command line was required for operating it, as there was no front end. Games will run at 60 frames per second (fps) and at a resolution of 400x200 from the original screen on Citra. Playing certain games can be similar to using a gamepad on an Xbox 360\. These characteristics are due to models and textures being sufficiently detailed in series.

**Pros:**

3DMOO is also one of the best 3Ds emulators for PC. ICHFLY, the company that developed the GBA emulator for the NDS, created the emulator. Users of Windows & Linux are the only ones who can run this Nintendo 3DS emulator. The processing would be too slow for all the commercial games of the Nintendo 3DS, though 3DMOO supports all of them. The game might crash frequently, ruining your gaming experience. It was being developed around 2014, but suddenly the development process was stopped, so it now functions only through the command line. Source code files for the emulator are available on Github.
