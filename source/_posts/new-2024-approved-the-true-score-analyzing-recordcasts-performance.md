## The True Score: Analyzing RecordCast's Performance

You would have probably needed the recording of the screen of your laptop, for that there are a plethora of options available on the internet. You may use them to produce comprehensive recordings as well as recordings that are limited to a single component or window. The disadvantage is that the free versions of this software sometimes include some very inconvenient restrictions, such as a relatively short time usage or bearing of those annoying presence of watermarks, which might negatively affect the result somewhat.

We introduce you to an amazing recording software RecordCast by PearlMountain company to record your screen and webcams online. It is a web-based application designed to capture your screen, webcam, and microphone input data. The interface to use the application is very user-friendly. Moreover, it provides free usage capability of up to 5 minutes of maximum recording time. However, for longer recordings, you might need to upgrade them. Let's have a detailed review of the RecordCast in the coming sections.

## Part 1: Key Features of RecordCast

Software is best analyzed by the features it has to offer. The RecordCast is equipped with amazing features that you can avail of directly online through the web. Let's discuss these features one by one to explore them for your ease.

****Free and User-Friendly**

The first and the foremost prevalent perk of a RecordCast is its free usage for its users. The application provides you to sign in free of cost to avail of its recording capabilities without any watermark issues. Moreover, the GUI of the web-based application is very easy to use that only needs a few steps to do the job.

****Multiple Recording Modes:**

With the 3 recording modes of the RecordCast, it leads all other similar software which usually has single recording modes. The three recording modes let you choose to record webcam + screen simultaneously or one at a time.

****All-in-One:**

The RecordCast is not only designed to record screens but with its video editing tools, you can now edit, trim, change colors, apply filters and put artistic effects on any video online. This amazing feature makes it a competitor for video editor tools too.

****Protected:**

With great care for privacy and security, RecordCast stores and edit your video or recordings locally. It doesn’t upload your content to the web servers instead, it never shares your content with any third party.

****Fair Pricing:**

The free version of RecordCast let you record a screen or webcam for a maximum of 5 minutes. However, it can be upgraded to its premium version so you can avail all its features by only paying 2.99 $ per month. This is very fair considering other similar software pricing.

****Compatibility:**

Due to the online nature of the RecordCast, it is compatible with any computer. Whether it is a Mac or Windows, you will not have to set up any compatibility settings before using it. This gives it an edge over other similar software.

****No Storage:**

Normally, you need to download an application and then install it for its usage. However, in the case of RecordCast, you save a considerable amount of storage by not installing it on your PC.
