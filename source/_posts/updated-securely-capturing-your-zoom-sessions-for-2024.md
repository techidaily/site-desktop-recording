## Securely Capturing Your Zoom Sessions

Zoom is the most preferred app for conducting online meetings. If the meeting is important, you should definitely record it with everyone's permission so that you can use the recorded video for any future reference. Besides, you can send the recorded Zoom meeting to anyone who could not be present in the meeting. Now the question arises, 'Can you record a Zoom meeting?'

Zoom app does not come with an inbuilt screen recorder for smartphone users. For computer users, there is a recording option available but it has too many limitations. That is why you have to opt for a third-party Zoom recorder for your computer or your smartphone. In this article, we will provide the list of the best zoom recorders and apps for PC, Mac, Android, and iPhone.
