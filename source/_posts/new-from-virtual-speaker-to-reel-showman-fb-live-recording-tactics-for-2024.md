On your iOS device, open the Settings app. Select Control Center and then Customized Controls from the drop-down menu. Scroll down to the Screen Recording option and touch the green (+) icon to the left of it; this will add the feature to the Control Center and make it visible in the Include section above. You may now quit the settings app with the screen recording function turned on. It's now time to put the feature to use.
