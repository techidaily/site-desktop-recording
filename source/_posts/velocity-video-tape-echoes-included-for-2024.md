## Part 1\. Steps to Use QuickTime Record Screen and Audio

If you are going to record a video playing on your Mac, QuickTime is a great choice. You can record your screen perfectly but the only issue is that QuickTime player screen recording audio feature is not available. That does not mean you cannot record screen as well as audio with QuickTime. Here are the steps on QuickTime how to record screen with sound.

Step 1: You will have to install a free extension called SoundFlower so that you can record audio through QuickTime along with recording the screen. Therefore, download [SoundFlower](https://soundflower.en.softonic.com/mac) free extension software. The main job of SoundFlower is to channel the audio playing from one application to another. Install SoundFlower application on your Mac from the downloaded file.

Step 2: Once you have installed SoundFlower on your Mac, restart your computer. This will ensure that there is no issue with QuickTime screen recording with sound.

Step 3: Go to Apple menu and open System Preferences.

![system preferences](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/system-preferences.jpg)

Step 4: Go to Sound tab and from Sound Output, select SoundFlower(2ch) option. This will make SoundFlower the active output by feeding the audio signal directly to SoundFlower instead of system speakers.

![soundflower](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-soundflower.jpg)

## Part 2\. How to Trim Videos in QuickTime Player

You may need to trim out some parts of the video to get rid of the unwanted parts and keep only the important parts. You can do the trim work easily in QuickTime Player and here are the steps to follow.

Step 1: Launch QuickTime Player and go to File > Open File option. Select the video file that you want to trim.

Step 2: Once the video file opens, go to Edit > Trim option. You can also press Command + T on your keyboard.

Step 3: You will see a yellow bar at the bottom containing the entire length of the video. In order to trim the video, you have to drag the handles from either side to trim out the unwanted parts. Therefore, after trimming, whatever the length of the video is there inside the yellow bar, the part of the video will remain and the out parts will be trimmed out.
