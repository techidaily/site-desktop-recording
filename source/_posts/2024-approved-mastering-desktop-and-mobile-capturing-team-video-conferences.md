One such program is [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) by Wondershare. Although Wondershare Filmora is primarily used for industry-standard post-product tasks such as video editing, apply effects and filters to the motion clips, etc., it offers the option to [record computer screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), webcam, and audio as additional features so you don’t have to depend on any other software for screencasting.

**Q3) Will people know if I start a recording on Teams meeting?**

**A3)** Yes. If you are using the Teams’ built-in recording feature to record a meeting, all the attendees will be notified about it. If you don’t want anyone to know that you are recording a session, you can use an efficient third-party app like Wondershare Filmora, and follow the steps explained earlier to learn **how to record Teams meeting** behind the scenes.
