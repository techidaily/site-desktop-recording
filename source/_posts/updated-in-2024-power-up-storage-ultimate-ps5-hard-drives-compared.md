If you cannot find the time to save all your games in the cloud, it is best to invest in an impressive PS5 external hard drive of 2024\.

## **Latest PS5 Update**

According to Sony, the owners of play station, the PS5 will expand the M.2 SSD storage in its console. The company made it known that users will be capable of storing PS5 games on any external hard drive of their choice.

This is one of the most remarkable ways to extend your PS5 console’s storage abilities.
