## Quickly Stop Live Feed Capture with QuickTime

QuickTime Player by Apple is the default media player on Mac, and the application comes pre-installed on Mac. Unlike other media players, QuickTime Player is not just for playing audio and video files. The application can record the screen on Mac and save the recordings on the hard drive. Therefore, there is no need for any third-party screen recorder for basic recording. However, many users have reported that they **cannot stop QuickTime screen recording** following the standard procedure.

When the application fails to stop recording, it fails to save the recording as well. Therefore, QuickTime Player keeps recording the screen, and this slows down the Mac as it keeps occupying the system resources. In this article, we will illustrate all the possible ways to QuickTime Player stop screen recording. We will also recommend a better alternative to QuickTime for professional-quality screen recording.

In the same way, you need to stop recording by clicking on the Stop button either on the top menu bar or the Recording bar. If this normal way of QuickTime Player stop screen recording does not work, you have to try out the following ways.

## 2\. Use Keyboard Shortcut to Stop QuickTime Recording

The best way to operate any screen recorder is by using the keyboard shortcuts. This is because when you record a screen with an application, the overlay bar stays hidden and if you move the mouse cursor to get the overlay bar, the cursor movement also gets recorded. Therefore, the best way to stop a recording is by pressing the default keyboard shortcut.

Coming to QuickTime Player, this method of QuickTime stop screen recording shortcut is only applicable when QuickTime Player has not frozen. If it is frozen, you have to force quit the application. Here are the steps to start recording normally and stop QuickTime recording using keyboard shortcut.

Step 1: Launch QuickTime Player and go to File> New Screen Recording. Instead of that, you can press Ctrl + Command + N keys together on your Mac keyboard.
