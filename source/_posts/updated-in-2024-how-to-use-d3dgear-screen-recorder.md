### Nvidia ShadowPlay

NVIDIA GeForce Shadowplay is a helpful extra application for the well-known GeForce Experience. It records your interactivity meetings and gives you a benefit over different players. Furthermore, the program works on your game insight and allows you to chip away at abilities successfully. While the 'record game' highlight is very helpful, the program requires substantial framework assets and works just with PCs having GeForce Experience introduced on the hard drive. You additionally need an NVIDIA illustrations card to utilize this product. NVIDIA GeForce Shadowplay is to some degree falling behind contending titles.
