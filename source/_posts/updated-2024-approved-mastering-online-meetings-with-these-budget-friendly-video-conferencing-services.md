 If you are looking for excellent online conferencing tools, then we advise you to check out FreeConference. Their whiteboard feature allows collaboration from all participants.

**Features**:

* Mobile compatible – probably the most thorough set of tools for Smartphone meetings.
* The whiteboard tool is entirely immersive, but we love that transcription/annotation service and the back catalog of meeting data.
* Free conference calls are unlimited and host up to 400 people.
