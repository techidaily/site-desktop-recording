## Part 1\. How to Record WhatsApp Call on PC?

Do you know that you can download WhatsApp for Windows or Mac, and you can enjoy WhatsApp video calling feature directly from your computer? You should visit whatsapp.com/download from the web browser of your computer and download and install WhatsApp for Desktop. Connect your WhatsApp account, and you can receive WhatsApp call from your WhatsApp contact anytime you want.

WhatsApp for Desktop or WhatsApp for Web has limited features. You cannot make calls, but you can receive calls. If you want all the features on your computer, you have to install WhatsApp through simulators like BlueStacks. If you want to record WhatsApp call on your computer, you need a WhatsApp call recorder. We recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to record anything on the screen with audio including WhatsApp video calls. Here are the steps to follow.

Step 1: Download and install Wondershare Filmora for Windows or Mac whichever is applicable.

You will get a few seconds to start WhatsApp video call and the [record computer screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) process will begin.

## Part 2\. How to Record a WhatsApp Call on Android?

WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app among Android users. WhatsApp has literally replaced text messaging and its free audio call feature is widely used as an alternative to traditional call. At the same time, users prefer WhatsApp video call over audio call for personal communication with contacts. Due to its usage more for personal communication over professional communication, there is no WhatsApp record feature available for security and privacy reason.

That is why you will need an external screen recorder app and we recommend AZ Screen Recorder. The app is free to use and very easy to operate. With a single tap, you can record anything on the screen including WhatsApp call. Here are the steps to follow to record WhatsApp call on Android.

![az screen recorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/az-screen-recorder.jpg)

## Part 3\. How to Record WhatsApp Video Call on iPhone?

There are two options available for iPhone users depending on iOS version of your iPhone. If you are using an iPhone with iOS 11 or higher, you can use the default screen recorder feature available to record WhatsApp call.
