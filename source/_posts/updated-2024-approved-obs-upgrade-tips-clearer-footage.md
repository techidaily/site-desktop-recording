## OBS Upgrade Tips: Clearer Footage

When you are live streaming through OBS Studio, encoding the video takes a lot of CPU resources. If you do not have a high-end computer, you are likely to face Encoding Overloaded issue while using OBS Studio. High encoding problem is rather common in OBS Studio because video recording and streaming demand high system resources which your computer is unable to meet.

In layman’s terms, encoding overloading means your hardware is just not running as fast as required to process the video you are streaming or recording. Since you cannot change your hardware configuration overnight, here are the different ways you can fix OBS high encoding when streaming.

## Way 1\. Downscale Your Output Resolution

The higher the resolution of the video recording or streaming, the greater will be the CPU usage. This is because your processor has to process more number of pixels per frame. That is why you have to lower the output resolution of your video. Even when your base resolution is high, you have to cut down the output resolution. Base resolution is the resolution of the video at source which could be the game you are playing. The output resolution is the resolution of the video you are getting after recording or you are streaming in real-time. Here are the steps to follow.

Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.

Step 2: Select Video tab. You will have to look for Output (Scaled) Resolution option.

Step 3: You have to reduce the resolution from the current resolution. If it is at 1920 x 1080p, you have to bring it down to 1280 x 720p.

Step 4: Click on Apply and Ok buttons. Restart your computer and start streaming or recording again.

## Way 2\. Lower Your Frame Rate

The frame rate of a video determines the number of frames captured per second. The higher the frame rate, the greater will be the pressure on GPU to render more number of frames per second. Unless you have a powerful configuration, you will come across OBS high encoding when streaming if the frame rate is high such as 60FPS. Here are the steps to lower the frame rate of your video on OBS.

Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.

Step 2: Go to Video tab and look for Common FPS Values option.

Step 3: If it is set to 60, you have to bring it down to 30\. Basically, you have to reduce the current value.

Step 4: Click on Apply and Ok button to save the new setting. Restart your computer and resume your OBS operation.

## Way 3\. Change Encoder Preset

By default, OBS uses x264 as encoder and the encoder preset is set to “veryfast”. This is generally the best and most balanced setting. However, if you are getting OBS high encoding warning, you have to change the encoder preset to reduce the CPU usage. Generally, the higher the preset, the lower is CPU usage. Therefore, you have to set the preset from “veryfast” to “ultrafast” and here are the steps.

Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.

Step 2: Go to Output tab and make sure that the encoder is Software(x264).

Step 3: Turn on Enable Advanced Encoder Settings option.

Step 4: Change the Encoder Preset from Veryfast to Ultrafast.

Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok button. Restart your computer and perform your action on OBS.

![obs change encoder preset](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-change-encoder-preset.jpg)

## Way 4\. Try Hardware Encoding

You can try out different hardware encoders available such as Quicksync, AMF, or NVENC. The availability of different hardware encoders depends on your computer hardware configuration. These hardware encoders are better than the default x264 encoder as they use less CPU resources. Since the issue is primarily with encoder, you should try changing the encoder and see if the problem is fixed.

Step 1: On OBS, you will have to go to Settings.

Step 2: Select Output tab and set Output Mode to Advanced.

Step 3: Go to Streaming tab, and check all the encoders available.

Step 4: Change the encoder from default x264 to any other hardware encoder available.

Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok to save the settings. Restart your computer and perform your operation on OBS.

![obs restart your computer and perform your operation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-restart-your-computer-and-perform-your-operation.jpg)

## Way 5\. Change Some Advanced Settings

If you are still facing OBS high encoding problem, you need to change some advanced settings in order to fix this encoder overloaded issue. You can change the keyframe interval so that your processor gets enough time for rendering. Similarly, you can change Rate Control from Constant to Variable so that the video does not demand high bandwidth.

Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.

Step 2: Go to Output tab and set Output Mode as Advanced.

Step 3: From Streaming tab, change Keyframe Interval and set it to 2 from zero.

Step 4: Change Rate Control from CBR to VBR.

Step 5: Change Profile from None to Main.

Step 6: Click on Apply and Ok button to save the changes. Restart your computer and check if the problem is resolved.
