## Legal Aspects and Ethical Considerations of Recording WhatsApp

WhatsApp is the most popular instant messaging app. Not just for instant messages, WhatsApp is also popular for its audio and video calling features. Most WhatsApp users use calling feature for personal communication. However, even corporates use WhatsApp to talk to team members and have a quick discussion. One of the common questions we come across from WhatsApp users “Can WhatsApp call be recorded?”

However, there is no default call recording option available. Therefore, you will need an external **WhatsApp call recording app** if you want to record your call on your Phone. Similarly, you will need an external software to record WhatsApp call on your computer. In this article, we will illustrate how to record a WhatsApp call in simple steps.
