## Master Your Clips on Mac: Explore Our Top 5 Snippers

Screenshots have become so ubiquitous that we don't pay much attention to them anymore. Yet, we use them day-in and day-out to show, explain, and communicate. Screenshots help us enrich and liven up our daily communication, whether it's sharing an image of a software bug with customer support, sending a quick how-to GIF to a colleague, or writing a heartfelt joke to a loved one.

Many Mac users need a widely-rated, multi-use MacBook snipping tool. All Mac users should know how to use the snipping tools, especially sales representatives and customer service representatives who use screenshots for product demos and troubleshooting. The simplest way to share your screen on Mac is by taking a screenshot.
