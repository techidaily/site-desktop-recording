## Part 1\. Free Ways to Record Mac Screen with Audio

Before getting to more advanced tools, it's better to go through a couple of free screen and audio recorders that you can use.

### Use QuickTime Player

If you are using a Mac, you must have used QuickTime Player to watch media. It's a tool that has multiple functions rather than just a player. It comes preinstalled on all the Macs and you will not need to pay any amount to unlock its features.

![quicktime player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-new-movie-recording.jpg)

Users will get to record the screen along with mic and system audio using this tool and while you are on it, you should know that it is just a recorder and not an editor. The interface that you will get is highly intuitive and user friendly where the recording process is extremely simple and straightforward.

How to record?

* Launch the Search and enter QuickTime Player. To get started with the recording, press and hold the Ctrl key, click on the app icon.
* Alternatively, you can open the app and click on the File button to screen record on Mac with audio. Click on the New Screen Recording button.
* It will greet you with a new compact dashboard that will offer a few controls for the screen recording. In the center, you will get a Record button with a few options in the dropdown menu to enable the mouse clicks.
* Here, you will also get to enable the mouse clicks to be recorded in the captured screen. It will help a lot of creators who are into creating guides and tutorials for their online audience.
* Once everything is set, it's time to hit the Record button and it will give you a drag & drop tool to make the screen selection. If you want to record the full screen, all you need to do is click anywhere on the screen to start recording.
* To select a specific area, you will need to drag and drop from any corner of the screen.

### Use Screenshot Toolbar

The above tool is the one with just the screen recording feature and the screenshot toolbar is the one with multiple functions. It is also preinstalled on all the Macs with MacOS Mojave and above.

![screen toolbar mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screen-toolbar-on-mac.jpg)

This tool offers you screen recording and snapshot with a plethora of options. You will get to select a specific window or area using the different selection options. This toolbar will also let you screen record Mac with internal audio. Let's go through the steps below.

How to record?

* Launch the content that you want to record and then, you will need to press the Cmd+Shift+5 combination to launch the screenshot toolbar.
* On the left, there will be options to take the screen snapshot according to your preference. The first tool will capture the full screen, the next will be used to capture a specific window, and the last will be used to make a custom selection.
* Right next to it, users will get the recording options. You can either go with recording the full screen or you can use the mouse to select a specific area.
* To get a few advanced settings, you will need to click on the Options button to access the dropdown menu. Here, you will also get to enable/disable the mic input.
* Once all the parameters for the Macbook screen recording with audio are set, it's time to hit the Record button. In the Options, you will also get to set up the save location.
