#### 2. [Jing](http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html)

Jing is a free screen recorder presented by TechSmith. It is a small but powerful tool that comes with essentials which allows you to capture images as well as videos and share to the Internet. Although Jing doesn’t have high end features, it is effective enough to plan, record and share the video within a very small time.

Being a free software, Jing still is backed up with the technical support of the TechSmith. However, Jing is not the best software tool for you when it comes to big projects, and you have to sign up and connect to your TechSmith account to use.
