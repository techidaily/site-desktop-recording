## Part 2: How to Remove Background Noise After a Recording Was Done

Now we know how to get rid of noise before a Skype video call, but what about the video that has already been recorded? How is it possible to remove the background noise and improve the voice quality?

Well don’t worry, the quality of these ‘already recorded videos’ can be improved by using applications like Filmora. There are a variety of applications that can do this function but we prefer Filmora because of its easy to use interface and amazing results.

So here we are going to show you how to remove background noise after a recording was already done by using its Denoise feature.

   1. Download Wondershare Filmora below and open it on your computer

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

   1. Go to **File**\-**I** **m** **port** **Media** to import the recorded file to the Media Library

![import-media8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-media8.jpg)

   1. Add or drag and drop the recorded file to the timeline. (If it’s a video that’s being imported preview and trim the unnecessary parts you wish to avoid, you can also detach the audio from the video directly using the **Audio Detach** feature)

![audio-detach6](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-detach6.jpg)

   1. Then right-click on the file on the timeline and select the Adjust Audio option
   2. Enable the **Remove background noise** option by checking it

![remove-background-noise7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-background-noise7.jpg)

1. Adjust the level of denoising to **Strong** by moving the pointer to the extreme right
2. Playback the recorded file on timeline and check whether the voice quality have been improved
3. Click **Export** to export the video to any supported formats.

#### To sum up

The advancement in technology and the development of apps like Skype have enabled us to be able to work from home even in extreme situations. Voice calls and video calls are an important part of working from home and their clarity and quality matter a lot, whatever your field of work may be. Hence you can try the hints in this article to **remove or get rid of background noise** and achieve a better audio/ video experience. If you have any suggestions, please comment on your thoughts below.
