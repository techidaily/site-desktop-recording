## Conclusion

Skype for Business allows the presenters to **record skype meeting** with all the details like video, audio, PowerPoint slides, etc. The in-app recording feature records every members’ video and audio at the same time. For the limitations of call recording on Mac, Wondershare Filmora can also be a good choice for you. It offers unparalleled features with an intuitive design, and you can record unlimited Skype calls and that with no limitation on Windows or Mac computer systems.
