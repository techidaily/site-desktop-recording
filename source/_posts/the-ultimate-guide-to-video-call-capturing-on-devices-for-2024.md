## Part 5: How to Record Teams Meeting Secretly?

Although Microsoft made Teams quite transparent by sending notifications to all the attendees as soon as you start recording a meeting, sometimes you may not want this to happen. In such a case, you must rely on a third-party app that can record your computer screen behind the scenes.

One such program is [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) by Wondershare. Although Wondershare Filmora is primarily used for industry-standard post-product tasks such as video editing, apply effects and filters to the motion clips, etc., it offers the option to [record computer screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), webcam, and audio as additional features so you don’t have to depend on any other software for screencasting.

With that said, the steps that are given below teach **how to record Teams meeting secretly** with Wondershare Filmora:

**Step 1: Get to the Wondershare Screen Recorder Panel**

Launch Wondershare Filmora on your PC (a Windows 10 computer is used here for illustration), click the **Record** menu from the top of the **Media** window, and click **Record PC Screen** from the menu that comes down.

**Step 3: Start Recording Teams Meeting Secretly**

After the recording preferences are set, click the **Record** button to start the screen recording. After this, use the method explained earlier to join or start a new Microsoft Teams meeting.

## FAQs About Microsoft Teams Meeting Recording

**Q1) Can I record a meeting in Microsoft Teams on mobile?**

**A1)** Yes. As long as you are using the correct license that comes along with the recording feature, you can record Microsoft Teams meetings on both Android and iOS devices. The licenses that allow recording are Office 365 Enterprise E1, E3, E5, F3, A1, A3, A5, M365 Business, Business Essentials, or Business Premium.

**Q2) Who can start or stop a recording of a Teams meeting?**

**A2)** The organizer of the meeting or a person from the same organization can start or stop the recording.

**Q3) Will people know if I start a recording on Teams meeting?**

**A3)** Yes. If you are using the Teams’ built-in recording feature to record a meeting, all the attendees will be notified about it. If you don’t want anyone to know that you are recording a session, you can use an efficient third-party app like Wondershare Filmora, and follow the steps explained earlier to learn **how to record Teams meeting** behind the scenes.
