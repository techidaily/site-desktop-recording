## Part 1\. How to Rotate Video in VLC on Windows

There are various reasons why you may want to rotate a video. It could be that the video has been taken at the wrong angle or you want to watch the video at a certain angle from a different perspective. The most common reason is that the video is taken in portrait mode and it looks small on your computer screen with black screen on both sides and you want to rotate the video to landscape mode. Here are the steps to perform VLC rotate video.

Step 1: Open VLC Media Player.

Step 2: Go to Media > Open File option and select the video file that you want to rotate.

Step 3: Once the video opens, go to Tools > Effects and Filters option.

![vlc tools option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-tools-option.jpg)

Step 4: From Adjustments and Effects window, go to Video Effects tab.

Step 5: Under Video Effects tab, go to Geometry tab.

Step 6: Check Transform option and from the drop-down menu, select the required options.

![vlc adjustments and effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-adjustments-effects.jpg)

The options available are – rotate by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, flip horizontally or vertically, transport and anti-transpose.

Step 7: If you want to rotate the video at any desired angle, you can check Rotate option and select the desired angle from the dial.

![vlc video effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-video-effects.jpg)

Step 8: Finally, click on Save button and then on Close button.

![save rotated video vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-rotated-video-vlc.jpg)

But note that this VLC rotate effect will stay with VLC and if you open any other video file, it will also be displayed as per your selected angle. In order to disable this rotation effect, follow the same steps and this time, uncheck Transform and Rotate options.
