Screencasting on any version of Windows 7/8/10 is a simple task, and countless software products enable you to record your desktop activities.

Most screen recorders create MP4 or MOV files that can get quite large, making them hard to send or easily distribute over the Internet.

On the other hand, GIFs are small in size, and sending them via email or posting them on social media networks won't require you to wait for a long time until the file is uploaded to the web.

However, there aren't that many screen recorders for Windows OS that let you save screen recordings as GIF files, and for that reason, we've composed the list of best **GIF Recorders** for PCs. Let's have a look at some of the most powerful software products for creating animated GIFs on Windows.

Fraps is probably one of the oldest screen recorders for gaming because it was released 18 years ago, and besides providing video capture features, it can also be used for benchmarking or displaying frame rates.

Fraps don't offer support for GIF files, which means that you can only use it to create an MP.4 or AVI file that you can later convert to GIF file format. Capturing videos and still frames outside of a video game is not on the list of options the software offers.

The free version of this screen recording utility can only record 30-second videos, which limits your screencasting possibilities and makes it a perfect tool for generating short videos that can be easily converted to GIFs, at the same time.
