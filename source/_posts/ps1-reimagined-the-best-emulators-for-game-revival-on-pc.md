There is also the Matsu Emulator, which is based on the PSX/PSOne platform. Despite being one of the best emulators in the world, it is also quite stable and safe. There are more and more features being added to the software. In contrast, the simulator works well but the free version has heavy advertising.

Rewinding in real-time and saving at multiple states are supported by the emulator. It also allows you to take screenshots instantly. Pictures are saved as PNG files.

The majority of Mednafen's cores are portions from other applications, but some are originals. In terms of quality, precision, and compatibility, its original cores (built to run PS1, Sega Saturn, and Nintendo Virtual Boy games) are noteworthy. The command-line interface of Mednafen is easy to use. Additionally, it supports several third-party GUIs to make configuration even easier. For example, MedLaunch offers a dynamic games library with DAT lookup and online scraping and the ability to configure controllers.

**Features:**

* Multi-platform emulation allows games to be played on PlayStation One as well as other gaming consoles.
* Compatible with most gaming consoles, including the PlayStation One, it is very accurate in its compatibility.

**Features:**

* Compatible with most gaming consoles, including the PlayStation One, it is very accurate in its compatibility.
* Providing you have the right PlayStation BIOS and ROM, it can be set up quickly and easily.

You can play PlayStation games on your Android phone and PC using ePSXe (short for enhanced PSX emulator). A wide range of devices are supported, making it a fast, accurate, and highly versatile tool. Within seconds, you can start playing games after configuring the program.

* Its controller options can be tailored to meet your needs.
* It allows you to pause, resume, and save your gameplay from the point you last left it.
