Would you like to play the classic Nintendo 3DS games on your latest android devices? This article is meant for you if that's the case!

The days of buying dedicated handheld consoles to fulfill entertainment needs on the go are long gone. The Gameboy, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation Vita, and Sony's PSP were the most commonly used gaming consoles a decade ago. As times change, we increasingly rely on our smartphones for a variety of activities. Smartphones are now so powerful that they can replace laptops and desktop computers because of their chipsets. Gaming on the go is by far the most intriguing development of smartphones.

Nintendo 3DS is certainly at the top of the list of most popular handheld gaming consoles, perhaps alongside the PSP and Gameboy. It is undeniable that the Nintendo 3DS has some of the greatest classic games of all time, and one can totally understand why people might be tempted to pick one up - even in 2024\. Since our smartphones are easily accessible, buying a new device just to play games that are already available would be a waste of resources. Using emulators, you are able to play games developed for other hardware on your phone.

If you search on google for the best 3DS emulators for Android, you will have limitless options, and you can easily get confused among so many choices, such as RetroArch, DraStic DS Emulator, NDS4droid, etc. We are lending you a helping hand as we have prepared a list of top 10 3ds emulators that you can use on your android smartphones and have the classic gaming experience.

**Price:** Free

This emulator has an intriguing name and does not appear good at first glance, but it is really good. A lot of sensors are used in their faster emulation, which makes the power consumption lower compared to other emulators. It is literally the best 3DS Android Emulator available, as it supports almost all games for Gameboy Advance and Nintendo 3DS. Both external and wireless controllers are supported.

On this emulator, cheat codes can also be used or disabled while playing Nintendo 3DS games. The backend has OpenGL in order to reduce the damage done to the GPU. It also has a fast-forward feature. In addition, the emulator has a clean graphical user interface which not many emulators possess, so we recommend it.

**Pros:**

* Emulation of gyros, tilts, soars, and rumble
* It consumes less power thanks to faster emulation

**Cons:**

There are advertisements on the emulator, but it is totally free to use. Although we do not currently know anything about a Pro version, there could be one. Compared to other 3DS emulators for Android, EmuBox has its pros and cons, which include bugs when too many cheat codes are used.

Its features are robust, with support for file formats such as .rar, .zip, .7z, and .nds, among others.
