If you are a Dell laptop user, there are going to be times when you may have to record your screen activities and send your recording across to your friends or colleagues. You have to screen record on Dell laptop when you want to make a tutorial video and post online. In fact, you can even screen record your gameplay on your Dell laptop and upload on video streaming platforms.

In order to screen record Dell laptop, you will need a screen recorder. There are free as well as premium screen recorders available. If you do not want to get a dedicated screen recorder application on your Dell laptop, you can opt for an online screen recorder as well. In this article, we have illustrated how to screen record on Dell laptop in all possible ways.

## Way 1\. Record with Game Bar

You most likely have Windows 10 installed on your Dell laptop. Windows 10 comes with an inbuilt screen recorder called Game Bar. You can record your screen as well as capture screenshots as per your requirements. You even capture your system as well as external mic audio. Besides, you can view your system performance from its widget. After capturing a screenshot, you can copy and paste it anywhere. Besides, you can share it on Twitter instantly.
