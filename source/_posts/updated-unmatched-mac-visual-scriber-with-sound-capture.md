Users will get to record the screen along with mic and system audio using this tool and while you are on it, you should know that it is just a recorder and not an editor. The interface that you will get is highly intuitive and user friendly where the recording process is extremely simple and straightforward.

How to record?

* Launch the Search and enter QuickTime Player. To get started with the recording, press and hold the Ctrl key, click on the app icon.
