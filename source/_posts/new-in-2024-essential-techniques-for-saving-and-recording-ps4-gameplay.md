Step 2: The USB or data cable should go from Capture card to your computer. The PS4 should be connected to your TV.

Step 3: Turn on PS4 and go to Settings on your TV screen. From Settings, go to System> System Information to check if PS4 software is updated. This is to ensure that what you see on your TV screen should also be on your laptop.

Step 4: On your computer, you can use any online screen recorder. If you have any inbuilt screen recorder that comes with your capture card, you can use the same. Start your gameplay and start recording on your computer.

## The Bottom Line

Hopefully, you have understood how to record videos on PS4\. If your gameplay is less than 60 minutes most of the time, you can do the recording with PS4 default screen recorder. However, for professional recording of your gameplay, we recommend you use Filmora to record gameplay on PSA via your computer. You can edit any part of the video and add transitions and video efforts to make it more eye-catching.
