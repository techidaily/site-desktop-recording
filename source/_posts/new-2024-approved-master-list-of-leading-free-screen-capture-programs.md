### 2. [Screencast-O-Matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/)

Screencast-o-Matic is the first of its kind free online screen recorder. It allows you to record any video playing on your screen and have it uploaded and shared. The video recorded online will have to be of the standard resolution, which could be 640×480 or 800×600 and other standard definitions. As your screen gets recorded, you can use text notes as overlays, which is not very different from how you would do on YouTube to get animations in place.

**Pros**:

* This free online screen recorder can support both screen and webcam recordings.
* It allows the users to share the output on YouTube.
* It also assists in drawing and zooming the video files.
* Many edit tools come with the Pro version to edit and personalize the videos.

**Cons**:

* The free version makes the watermark visible, unlike the Pro version.
* You can only record 15 minutes of recording with the free version.
* Screencast-O-Matic requires Java.
* It can record computer audio but the feature is only for Window running computers.

### 9. [Vidyard Online Screen Recorder](https://www.vidyard.com/free-screen-record/)

Unlike the others on our list so far, Vidyard lets you combine the online and offline sides of things. You can record and create new videos on your own – or you can pull something off the internet for quickness or help you remember important information. In addition, Vidyard lets you track your views, manage analytical data, and even embed your videos in other places.

**Pros**:

* The embed feature lets you monetize videos online without resorting to the main video watching/sharing websites.

### 10\. Screenr

Screenr is remarkable because it excels in the annotation. Annotating is a hard thing to get right without confusing the user. Screenr manages to do it well, without all of the getting lost, undoing your notes, and having to add them again offline. It also allows seamless file sharing, which is excellent if you are a lecturer or a project manager.

**Pros**:

* This is a high-performing platform that is programmed for speed.
* One-click capture and share of annotations.
* A significant focus on document annotations that make it clean-cut and professional.

**Cons**:

* The emphasis on speed seems to minimize the tools available.
* The video capture could be better.

### 11. [Bewisse](https://record.bewisse.com/)

Lewis is a smart-but-friendly looking free online screen recorder service that is entirely free. Unfortunately, it isn’t compatible with the Microsoft Edge internet browser, which is weird. Programmed to run with Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, Bewisse perhaps works best with Apple or Mac OS’s. However, they have a great free screenshot capture feature that doesn’t need a login.

**Pros**:

* You don’t need to set up an account with them, log in, or give away any details.
* There is no installation required to use it.
* It is entirely free to use.

**Cons**:

* It’s a little on the primary side.
* It only works if you have a Firefox or Chrome browser.
