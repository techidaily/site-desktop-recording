## Part 1: How Does the Mute Button in Google Meet Work?

The mute button in Google Meet is like a blessing in disguise, with just one click you can silence your mic. This way the participant can still hear what is going on in the session, but they are not audible to anyone else. So, if for instance, you are only a listener in the session and do not want to contribute, then you can mute your microphone.

Additionally, if an individual wants to participate in a meeting, they can unmute their microphone and then quickly mute it again once they have contributed. With just one click, the host of the meeting can also mute everyone in the session so there are no extra sounds or distractions.

However, if they do not want to make use of the screen to mute and unmute, they can use keyboard key shortcuts. For Mac users, the relevant keys are CTRL - COMMAND - M. If you are making use of a different desktop or laptop then it is simply CTRL - M.

## Part 3: How to Mute Someone in Google Meet?

There are times when individuals are not aware that the background noise of their surroundings is causing a disturbance in the meeting. That is when muting someone can come in handy! Basically in this, a host or other participants in the meeting can mute an individual based on need. However, there is an eligibility criterion they must adhere to in order to get the muting permissions.

### The Eligibility Criteria To Mute Someone in Google Meet

Before looking into **how to mute someone on Google Meet**, check if any of the following scenarios apply to you,

* During video calls that are hosted through personal Google accounts, only the moderator can mute a person.
* Google Meet calls made through Google workspace accounts only permit a person, from the domain which organized the meeting, to mute a participant.
* During a video call arranged by using an educational Google account, only the individual who has created the meeting / is the owner of a calendar can mute other individuals.

So, if any of these circumstances apply to you, then you can easily mute someone in a Google Meet session. The process involves the following steps,

Click onto a participant’s picture and click Mute or if this step is not working for you, then at the bottom right of your video room on Google Meet, click people , once you do that a menu will appear on the side of your screen.

Click on the arrow next to the name of the person you would like to mute. Once you do that, a drop-down menu will appear with three options.

## Part 6: How to Remove Someone From Google Meet With/Without Being A Host?

Don’t you just hate it when there is too much distortion or disturbance in a session because of another participant? Well, lucky for everyone, Google Meet has a “remove from the meeting” feature as well. In this, individuals can remove other people from the meeting, if they aren’t meant to be in the session or if they are causing challenges in the meeting. They can do this while being the host and even when they are not the host of the meeting.
