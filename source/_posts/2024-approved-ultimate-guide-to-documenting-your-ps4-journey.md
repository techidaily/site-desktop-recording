Step 2: The USB or data cable should go from Capture card to your computer. The PS4 should be connected to your TV.

## The Bottom Line

Hopefully, you have understood how to record videos on PS4\. If your gameplay is less than 60 minutes most of the time, you can do the recording with PS4 default screen recorder. However, for professional recording of your gameplay, we recommend you use Filmora to record gameplay on PSA via your computer. You can edit any part of the video and add transitions and video efforts to make it more eye-catching.
