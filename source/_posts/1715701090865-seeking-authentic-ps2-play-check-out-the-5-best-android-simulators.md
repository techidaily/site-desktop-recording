## FAQs

**How can I use the PS2 Emulator for Android to play PS2 games?**

Unless you have the ISO file plus the PS2 BIOS file, the best ps2 emulator android games won't work. Using Google, you may quickly find the ISO file for a given game. The "Unknown sources" tab in your phone's settings should be enabled. Apps from unknown sources may now be installed. This is good news. It is necessary to copy & paste the ISO file into the Emulator's folder after downloading the game. You'll need to have a PlayStation 2 BIOS in order to run certain emulators like DamonPS2 Pro, for example. On Google, you may also download this file and put it into the app's folder. It's now possible to choose a game to play after having BIOS installed. The PS2 BIOS will then be requested. Return to tapping the game after selecting the BIOS file. After you've done this, all you have to do is wait for the program to load so that you can begin playing.

Ps2 emulator for android, on the other hand, only play PS2 games. FPse, a PSX game emulator for Android, is required if you want to play PSX games on your phone or tablet.
