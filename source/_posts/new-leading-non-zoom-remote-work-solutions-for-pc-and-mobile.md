## FAQs about Zoom Meeting Alternatives

#### 2\. What is the best Zoom alternative for teaching?

Plus, it should also facilitate class activities, such as presentations, file sharing.

#### 3\. What is the best Zoom alternative for musicians?

Musicians cannot compromise on video and audio quality during their music recordings. Plus, they also freak out when video lags or jitters. So, they prefer applications with minimal noise distortion and robust mechanisms to deal with background noise. LANDR, Discord, and Reapers are the few **Zoom alternatives** for musicians

However, this does not mean that Zoom will fit all requirements. If you are bored of Zoom’s interface or want to host meetings for more than 40 minutes, switching **to Zoom alternatives** is not a bad thing. The above-mentioned video communication platforms will help you make a choice if you are looking for other options.
