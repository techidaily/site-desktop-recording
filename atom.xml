Key Features of SplitCam"></a>2. Key Features of SplitCam</h2><p>Even though it is a completely free video recorder, there are loads of useful features for the users. Here are the key features of SplitCam that you should be aware of.</p><p>Record From Different Sources – You can record webcam video, desktop screen, IP camera, web browser screen, as well as your gameplay. Besides, you can record audio from different sources. In fact, you can record another video, image, PDF document, slideshow, and much more in the background.</p><p>Video Effects – There are loads of video effects available to apply to webcam videos. Besides, there are realistic 3D masks available, and you can replace heads and faces with 3D objects. This will enhance the video content and allow you to create fun videos.</p><p>Live Streaming: With Splitcam, you can live stream to different video services like Justin.tv, UStream, and Livestream instantly. Besides, SplitCam allows you to use webcam with several applications without any issue. You can also upload your video to YouTube instantly.</p><p>Useful Features: The zoom feature is really great for highlighting the needed part. When you are making explanatory video, the zooming feature is a necessity for everyone to focus on the right part. Besides, you can capture screenshots instead of video as well. The software also shows the performance parameters for better understanding.</p><p>HD recording – SplitCam lets you record the desired video from any video source as per the video resolution you need. The software supports up to 2048x1536 video resolution. You can adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpen, and other parameters to enhance the video quality.</p><p>Moreover, you can use hotkeys to operate the software smoothly, and the user interface is quite simple and easy to operate.</p><h2 id="3-In-depth-Review"><a href="#3-In-depth-Review" class="headerlink" title="3. In-depth Review"></a>3. In-depth Review</h2><p>Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.</p><p>Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.</p><p>Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.</p><p>Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p><p>Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134491/18498" target="_top" id="2134491">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134491" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134491/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Best-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4.

However, it fails to produce the output as a professional-quality video recorder. You cannot record video in 4K resolution and SplitCam lacks editing options after recording. Besides, there are limited output file formats available. Hence, we recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best alternative to SplitCam.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-expert-psd-borderline-elegance/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Expert PSD Borderline Elegance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-seamless-video-broadcasting-via-microsoft-stream/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Seamless Video Broadcasting via Microsoft Stream</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-depth-look-at-frozen-delight-recording-software/"><u>[New] In-Depth Look at Frozen Delight Recording Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-perfectly-prepared-videos-a-guide-to-instagram-fitness-for-2024/"><u>[New] Perfectly Prepared Videos A Guide to Instagram Fitness for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-guide-to-crypto-conversion-best-generator-list/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Guide to Crypto Conversion – Best Generator List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-adobe-lightroom-essentials-review/"><u>[Updated] Adobe Lightroom Essentials Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-quickscreenrecorder-easy-captures-anytime/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, QuickScreenRecorder Easy Captures, Anytime</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-mirror-apple-iphone-se-to-mac-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Mirror Apple iPhone SE to Mac? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-preparation-to-beat-giovani-in-pokemon-go-for-oppo-reno-11f-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Preparation to Beat Giovani in Pokemon Go For Oppo Reno 11F 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/life360-learn-how-everything-works-on-infinix-hot-30-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Life360 Learn How Everything Works On Infinix Hot 30 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/revolutionary-computing-arrives-ampere-one-aurora-cpu-featuring-a-giant-leap-in-power-with-its-512-cores-and-enhanced-ai-capabilities/"><u>Revolutionary Computing Arrives: Ampere One Aurora CPU - Featuring a Giant Leap in Power with Its 512 Cores & Enhanced AI Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-to-catch-the-regional-located-pokemon-for-apple-iphone-7-plus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Ultimate Guide to Catch the Regional-Located Pokemon For Apple iPhone 7 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The PlayStation 2 was released to compete with Nintendo’s SNES, which ruled the console video-gaming market for years. Sony launched its first-ever gaming console after years of reorganizations and partnerships, including ones with Nintendo. The console was immensely successful until its successor replaced it.</p><p>With the PS1 emulator for PC, you can play PlayStation 1 games. Play your favorite PlayStation games on your computer with the original BIOS, your own BIOS, and your own games. Listed below, you will find some of the best PS1 emulators that will allow you to relive those days. If you have an original game disk, even better.

Because of its name, it may seem to be a complex program, although it is quite popular among Windows users. This utility is also compatible with games that use OpenGL or DirectX graphics. When it comes to FRAPS, many things raise the standard, but the competition it provides to its counterparts while remaining affordable is unrivaled. Older versions of Windows, such as Windows XP, are also supported by FRAPS. This function is exceptional since it is not available in any other screen recorder. It is, on the other hand, simple to use and has a fluid drag-and-drop feature that elevates it to the top of the hierarchy.</p><p>Fraps is one of the most well-known third-party programs for PC gamers, thanks to its free and simple benchmarking features that can test the performance of almost any game. It’s also a simple method to put a frame rate counter in the corner of your screen to keep an eye on in-game performance second by second. FRAPS can capture up to 7680 x 4800 at bespoke frame rates ranging from 1 to 120 frames per second, making it stand out among its peers. Skype calls from online or video games are among the features available. It can also record sounds through a microphone, making it the most versatile of all the options thus far. There is no way to capture webcam footage or create a timeline. It also can’t add video titles or capture audio from the system. None of these drawbacks, we believe, are relevant to video game recording fans. FRAPS has numerous drawbacks despite its low cost and flexibility.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123737/7443" target="_top" id="2123737">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123737" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123737/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Download-and-Install"><a href="#1-Download-and-Install" class="headerlink" title="1.

Minimized start, always on top view, show status on LCD, minimize to system tray exclusively, and more options are available under Fraps’ general settings.

There are four tabs in this little window: General, FPS, Movies, and Screenshots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fraps.jpg"                      alt="fraps"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118326/7443" target="_top" id="2118326">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118326" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118326/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Fraps’ benchmarking tools are located under the FPS tab. When Fraps is active, the framerate counter is always visible in-game. If you want to record a benchmark while playing, just press F11, but first adjust the benchmarking parameters under FPS &gt; Benchmark Settings to your desire.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fps.jpg"                      alt="fps"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> Stop the recording, then go to the Movies tab to see how Fraps is recording your game. Some choices are accessible in the free version, while others are not. The loop buffer length is deactivated, which allows you to use the hotkey to record the latest “X” seconds of gameplay. You may, however, choose whether you want a full-size or half-size recording and select the maximum frame rate when recording. You may also change the sound capture settings, record your microphone, hide or show the mouse pointer, lock the framerate while recording, and capture lossless RGB.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/movies.jpg"                      alt="movies"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2121331/18498" target="_top" id="2121331">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2121331" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2121331/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#3-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="3.

The above-mentioned video communication platforms will help you make a choice if you are looking for other options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424531">                    <video width="864" height="NaN" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424531.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424531">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424531.png"                      style="border: none;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Global-Perspective-Inclusive-Technology-Review"><a href="#Global-Perspective-Inclusive-Technology-Review" class="headerlink" title="Global Perspective: Inclusive Technology Review"></a>Global Perspective: Inclusive Technology Review</h2><p>EaseUS RecExperts is a screen recording program for Windows that allows users to capture a complete screen or a select area of it, as well as record narrator voice or system noises and improve the overall quality of the individual clip. Within a PC, the system may be utilized to create professional-looking films. Camera video recording is supported by EaseUS RecExperts, allowing users to shoot movies inside the webcam or as an overlay, allowing for higher levels of involvement. You may record the whole screen, a specific region, or even a locked window with EaseUS RecExperts. Additionally, while recording, you may annotate your screen, label an area, and do other editing activities. You can rapidly export or distribute your recording to various platforms, depending on your preferences.</p><p>EaseUS RecExperts is a multi-purpose but simple-to-use Windows screen recorder that allows you to record and capture everything on your computer’s screen. Thanks to its simple and well-organized interface, you can get started quickly. You may record your screen, audio, and camera independently or all at once. In addition, the game recording option enables you to record your games in whatever way you desire. Annotation, cutting, watermark insertion, and other sophisticated editing tools are included in the program. The recordings may be exported in a variety of file formats, including MP4, AVI, and WMV. They may even upload the created video to YouTube immediately. Noise reduction and audio enhancement are also included in the software’s capabilities. It comes with its game recording mode, capable of capturing popular 2D&#x2F;3D games in 4K UHD quality. Users may use the built-in task planner to complete their recording tasks on time and in an automatic manner.</p><h2 id="1-Price-and-Tech-Specifications"><a href="#1-Price-and-Tech-Specifications" class="headerlink" title="1. Price and Tech Specifications"></a>1. Price and Tech Specifications</h2><p>EaseUS RecExperts cost $11.97 a month, $23.97 a year, or $69.95 for the rest of your life. A single license for one machine is included in this price. It’s worth noting that you can test out the program for free. The trial version restricts you to two-minute recordings and adds a watermark to your movies.</p><p>Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Mac OS are all supported by EaseUS RecExperts. Initially, EaseUS Screen Recorder was only available for Windows, but a Mac OS version was eventually published. The program will be installed as a standalone app on your system disk. There are no further add-ons required. When recording games, RecExperts also allows you to alter the frame rate up to 60 frames per second. RecExperts is starting to look like a first-class application for all kinds of on-screen recording requirements, with the ability to output to 10+ commonly used recording formats (including MP4, MOV, and MP3), the ability to make GIFs directly from screen captures, and the ability to automatically stop and split recordings based on time or file size limits.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130875/7443" target="_top" id="2130875">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130875" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130875/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-How-to-Use-RecExperts"><a href="#2-How-to-Use-RecExperts" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Use RecExperts"></a>2. How to Use RecExperts</h2><p>EaseUS RecExperts is a premium screen recording software for Windows and Mac OS created by EaseUS.com. It’s a multi-purpose screen recorder that can do both screen recording and Webcam recording. RecExperts may also record full-screen or a specific part of the screen. The free trial version of RecExperts can be downloaded fast and conveniently from the EaseUS website, and the installation can be started right away.</p><p>Step 1: Launch EaseUS RecExperts</p><p>As can be seen in the screenshot below, the first function that is pre-selected for us when we launch the RecExperts program is the one that is necessary for capturing the complete default computer display. We have simple access to all of the software’s key functionalities as well as the main settings menu for modifying, among other things, the default file formats utilized, from this main program window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/easeus-recexperts.jpg"                      alt="easeus recexperts"                ></p><p>Step 2: Setup the Recording</p><p>For improved content distribution, you may record the single Webcam or use the Webcam as an overlay on a movie. With simplicity, you may pick full-screen recording, a specific portion of the screen, or a single window. Simply pressing the orange “REC” button will start the recording process; the main program windows will vanish at this point, being replaced by a smaller control window, as seen below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-setup-the-recording.jpg"                      alt="setup the recording"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139108/17108" target="_top" id="2139108">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139108" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139108/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 3: Finish&#x2F;Save Recording</p><p>We may finish the recording by clicking the red “stop” button after the screen recording is complete (which will, by default, include any sound outputted by the device during this process). When the recording is finished and the stop button is pushed, the RecExperts program will open the freshly recorded clip in the RecExperts editing suite, where we may continue to work with the material:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-recoring.jpg"                      alt="save recording"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135364/19272" target="_top" id="2135364">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135364" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135364/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#3-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="3.

This powerful program lets you capture a portion of your screen, overlay video from a camera, and record audio on top of it all.

Alternative to RecExperts</h2><p>RecExperts is no doubt, a fantastic <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording program <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with excellent customer service. Filmora, on the other hand, maybe of interest if you want additional bells and whistles. RecExperts Screen Recorder has compiled a list of reasons why you should look into screen recorder software. It is a useful screen recording app for Windows 10&#x2F;8.2.8&#x2F;7&#x2F;XP that allows you to capture any movement in any size. We can capture the screen using screen projection software, but it isn’t enough to generate a convincing movie or YouTube video instructive lesson. We’ll need video recording and editing software that can provide a clear screen recording for this. This is why we looked at Wondershare Filmora, a video recorder and editor available for both Windows and Mac OS.</p><p>Wondershare Filmora’s video recording and editing software comes with a comprehensive range of video capture and editing features, making it the finest alternative to RecExperts screen recorder software. Filmora allows you complete control over everything from the screen’s size to how you capture and edit video. Not only that, but it also allows you to upload media files, record the screen with sound, export movies to MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV, GIF, MP3, modify video effects, Bitrate, Frame rate, and change the sound when transmitting to the online community. This keeps your movie looking neat while keeping it interesting. You may generate a green screen effect, make adjustments, add stickers, subtitles, add comments, cursor effects, notes, callouts, trim video, denoise it, increment, fade-in&#x2F;fade-out volume, and much more after the screen is selected for recording and recorded.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Record-with-Filmora"><a href="#Steps-to-Record-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="**Steps to Record with Filmora:"></a>**<strong>Steps to Record with Filmora:</strong></h3><p>Step 1.
