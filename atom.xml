For instance, users can also record their desktop and convert the videos to various formats. And hence, if you wish to opt for recording using your laptop with an already equipped microphone, camera, and more, this software will do that for you in minutes.</p><p>Today, we will look at the step-by-step process to record webcam VLC. Also, we will discuss a few alternative options that you may put to use for the same.However, at first, let’s see how to record your webcam with VLC:</p><p>Part 1. <a href="#part1">VLC Webcam Recording Guide</a></p><p>Part 2. <a href="#part2">VLC Alternatives to Record Webcam</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-VLC-Webcam-Recording-Guide"><a href="#Part-1-VLC-Webcam-Recording-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. VLC Webcam Recording Guide"></a>Part 1. VLC Webcam Recording Guide</h2><p>VLC player is one of the best recording software for beginners to experts. You can do everything on this single app. If you are searching for software to record videos from a webcam, it is one of the best choices. Let’s start with how to record webcam VLC.</p><p>Step 1: - First, you update our webcam’s firmware. Once you have completed it, you can launch the VLC, visit the view tab, and check out the advanced controls. It will help you put some extra toolbar with the record button on the left corner.</p><p>Step 2: - Next, visit media and click on the capture device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-screen-with-VLC.jpg"                      alt="open capture device"                ></p><p>Step 3: - Now, keep the capture mode as the “DirectShow” and select the audio input and video camera device from the menu.</p><p>You can use any device for both audio and video. It depends upon the setup, and you will choose between various video and audio devices. You must select the right one according to your setup.</p><p>Step 4: - Another option you may want is to select the Advanced options button and then plug in the specific framerate for a video. You can set it up around 30fps, and then you can do a great job by keeping the size of the video file down. You may have to experiment with it a few times to get the best video quality you wish.</p><p>Step 5: - Once you have finished the selection of your video and audio device and set up the frame rate down, then click the Play button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-screen-with-vlc-11.png"                      alt="save vlc recording"                ></p><p>Step 6: - You will have to see yourself or anything you pointed your camera at the main windows. Then, you will have to hit the record button on the toolbar, which you can add earlier for starting the recording.</p><p>Step 7: - For stopping the recording, you will have to hit stop or record again to close the video recording completely. The users will have to find the recording in local video folders on the PC saved as the AVI files.</p><p>Step 8: It is worth noting that if you plan to record your voice, you will have to wear the headset or manage the audio device. Otherwise, the user will hear the voice’s echo through external speakers. The process is very similar for recording the desktop, but you have to choose various media devices.</p><p>In addition, you will need the recording in other formats, and you can also. Finally, use the VLC for converting the videos.

Comparison ShadowPlay vs OBS"></a>Part 2. Comparison ShadowPlay vs OBS</h2><p>Here are the key points of differences between OBS and ShadowPlay that will help you decide between OBS or ShadowPlay.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS</strong> <strong>Recording:</strong></p><p>While recording, OBS allows faster processing of the recorded video files. Besides, it can compress the file size during the encoding process so that the recorded video files take relatively less space. This makes it ideal for longer sessions of gameplay recording. However, in the process, OBS can reduce the frame rate significantly, and hence, the video may not be as smooth as you expect it to be. Therefore, OBS is suitable for regular game recording where not much compression is required.</p><p>On the contrary, ShadowPlay does not reduce the file size or frame rate, and hence, it is a great choice for high-end games where you need the recorded to be as smooth as possible. However, ShadowPlay requires more space on the hard drive. When you upload on video streaming platforms, there will be some automatic compression. Therefore, the less compression you do during your encoding phase, the better will be the output.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Performance:</strong></p><p>OBS uses significant CPU power and resources. This is one of the reasons why it reduces the frame rate while recording to use less CPU resources. In fact, it can affect the game performance if you are playing and recording a high-end game. However, you can customize various configuration parameters to reduce its burden on CPU performance.</p><p>ShadowPlay does not affect the CPU performance as it comes with hardware acceleration. It supports higher frame rates for high-end games as well. If at all, it can bring about 5%-10% effect on CPU performance which is almost ignorable in comparison to OBS.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS File Format</strong>:</p><p>OBS consumes less space for recorded videos. It compresses the format which can drastically reduce the output file size. The best thing about OBS is that it comes with the NVENC hardware encoded chip that allows choosing from different supported file formats.</p><p>On the contrary, ShadowPlay supports MP4 formats by default which makes it require more space. It uses  codec. MP4 file format is the most popular video file format that you can play across all media players and upload on online platforms.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Live Streaming</strong>:</p><p>You cannot live stream as well as record on ShadowPlay. This is a major drawback that OBS has overcome. That is why most gamers prefer OBS Studio for live streaming as they can record the gaming session for future reference. If you want to just broadcast your gameplay, ShadowPlay is good enough. But if you want to have multiple scenes and overlay adjustments in live streaming, OBS is the best choice.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Editing:</strong></p><p>OBS offers better editing options thanks to its built-in editor. Starting customizable transitions to real-time editing before broadcasting, OBS has different editing scopes tailor-made for gamers. On the contrary, ShadowPlay has very limited editing options as the main focus is on recording only. But if we talk about true video editing, both applications are still underdeveloped on this front.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38709260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF Perpetual (2-PC)  Free upgrade. No monthly fees ever. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Alternative-Way-To-Record-Games"><a href="#Part-3-Alternative-Way-To-Record-Games" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Most Mac users never have the need to change this setting, because they can always move the file to a folder where they want to store it. On the other hand, creating a lot of screenshots every day can make a chaos on your desktop. Luckily changing the destination where your screenshots are saved is a simple process that lets you decide where your images will be stored.</p><p>Here’s how you can change the location where the screenshots you take using the keyboard shortcuts will be saved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Save-Screenshots-to-a-Specific-Folder-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Save-Screenshots-to-a-Specific-Folder-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Save Screenshots to a Specific Folder on Mac"></a>Part 1: How to Save Screenshots to a Specific Folder on Mac</h2><p>Changing the folder where you store your screenshots is not an irreversible process, which means that you can reset the destination where the files are saved to Desktop at any point. Do not delete the new folder, because your Mac may not be able to take screenshots, afterward. The process described below is the only way you can delete a folder or add a new destination for your screenshots, and failing to comply with it may cause your Mac to malfunction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mac-screenshot-terminal.jpg"                      alt=" Mac Screenshots"                ></p><p>Create a new folder on the desired location on your hard drive, and then launch Terminal, by typing Terminal in the Search Box and clicking on its icon. Once the app is open, you should insert the following command into the Terminal window:</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screencapture location</strong></p><p>Then enter a space at the end after ‘location’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mac-screenshot-terminal-settings.jpg"                      alt=" Mac Screenshots"                ></p><p>The next step is to add the new location at which screenshots will be saved and you can do this by simply dragging the folder you created into Terminal and adding it at the end of the command you just entered. A path is created and the command line should now contain the folder’s unique location and it should look like this:</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screencapture location &#x2F;Users&#x2F;username&#x2F;Screenshots</strong></p><p>To execute the command you have to press Enter. After Terminal finishes running the command, its window will appear on the screen again. You should proceed to confirm the changes you’ve just made by resetting the User Interface on your computer. In order to do so, you’ll have to insert this command below the one you previously entered：</p><p><strong>killall SystemUIServer</strong></p><p>Hit Enter once more to confirm the changes and run the new command. Close Terminal app by clicking on the Terminal menu and selecting the Quick Terminal option. The default location where the screenshots are saved on your Mac is now changed and every time you take a screenshot using the Command + Shift + 3 shortcut the file will be saved at the new location. If for whatever reason you want to make the Desktop once again the destination where the screenshots on your computer will be saved here’s how you can do it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4728277&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/f7f07e7dab09533bc71247a5b29a7373/products/1_iDeviceMessageBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-the-Screenshot-Save-Location-Back-to-Desktop"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-the-Screenshot-Save-Location-Back-to-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change the Screenshot Save Location Back to Desktop"></a>Part 2: How to Change the Screenshot Save Location Back to Desktop</h2><p>The process of changing the default screenshot save location back to Desktop is nearly identical to the process we just described. You just have to open the Terminal app and insert the following command into the prompt.</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screen capture location &#x2F;Users&#x2F;Username&#x2F;Desktop&#x2F;</strong></p><p>Make sure that your username is properly written, and then press Enter to run the command. Now you only have to reset the UI so it can recognize the changes you’ve made, and you can do it by inserting the <strong>killall SystemUIServer</strong> command into the Terminal window and pressing Enter to execute it.</p><p>Don’t forget that deleting the folder you use as a default location for storing screenshots should only be done using the process we just described in the Terminal application, since all other methods may cause unnecessary trouble.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Running a session online can be a daunting task - with the right tools, information, and resources it can be smooth sailing. There are three main video conferencing apps available, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and an app that trumps them all - Google Meet.</p><p>Google Meet is a video calling app that comes fully equipped with numerous features, such as screen presenting. If you are looking to perfect your hand on Google Meet, then read through this comprehensive guide on <strong>how to present ppt in Google Meet</strong>!</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Present PowerPoint Presentations in Google Meet on Laptop</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Present Google Slides in Google Meet on Laptop</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Present PowerPoint or Slides in Google Meet On iPhone and iPad</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Present PowerPoint or Slides in Google Meet on Android</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Stop Presenting PPT on Google Meet</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Present-PowerPoint-Presentations-in-Google-Meet-on-Laptop"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Present-PowerPoint-Presentations-in-Google-Meet-on-Laptop" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Present PowerPoint Presentations in Google Meet on Laptop"></a>Part 1: How to Present PowerPoint Presentations in Google Meet on Laptop</h2><p>With remote working on the rise, Google Meet enables users to showcase and share PowerPoint slides during online meetings and sessions. Whether it is a meeting, online class, or brainstorming session, it becomes a whole lot easier with a PowerPoint slideshow - bringing everyone on the same page!</p><p>You must be wondering <strong>how to share ppt in Google Meet</strong>, well the process is fairly simple and extremely functional. You will only need two tools to execute this screen-sharing process, a web browser, and Microsoft PowerPoint. We would advise that you use Google Chrome as your web browser as it works best with Google Meet.</p><p>Just a heads up, when you are presenting your screen on Google Meet, everyone can see what you display, so it’s best to open up your PowerPoint slides before joining the meeting so there are no surprises!</p><ol><li>Open the Microsoft PowerPoint Slides on your laptop, the model or brand of the laptop does not matter, as long as you have Microsoft PowerPoint on it</li><li>Convert your slides from the default mode to browsed by an individual mode. If you have used Microsoft PowerPoint before, then you must know that in slideshow mode the slides appear in fullscreen making it difficult to switch between applications, therefore by converting the PowerPoint it will be windowed fullscreen, allowing the presenter to switch between applications. The process is simple, just click the “Slide Show” tab, then “Set Up Slide Show”, and from the drop-down menu press “Browsed by an Individual”.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/powerpoint-browsed-by-individual.jpg"                      alt="set PowerPoint to individual browse"                ></p><ol><li>After setting up the PowerPoint slides, move over to Google Meet and join the meeting through the meeting link provided or schedule in a new meeting. You have two options: either you can join the meeting and then share your slides, or share the PowerPoint while joining the session. If you decide to go with the second option, you must click “Present now” and continue with the steps below.</li><li>To share your <strong>Google Meet PPT presentation</strong> just click the “Present Now” button on the bottom right-hand side of the screen.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-present-now.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet Present Now   "                ></p><p>There you will see two options and must click one of the following options,</p><ul><li>Your entire screen - if you would like to share your entire screen, this means any application which you see, other participants in the meeting will see as well</li><li>A window - this allows the presenter to share only one selected window in the meeting (this option is advised)</li><li>A tab - this is best for presenting a video or animations, not a PowerPoint</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-present-now-options.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet Present Now Options   "                ></p><ol><li>If the presenter decides to go with the “A Window” option then click the window that shows your PowerPoint slides then select share.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-powerpoint-on-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="Share PPT on Google Meet  "                ></p><p>The slideshow will automatically start to broadcast to viewers.

The process is quite similar to that of sharing a PowerPoint, but there are a few changes.</p><p>So to answer your question on <strong>how to present slide in Google Meet</strong>,</p><ol><li>Open up your Google Slides, go over to the Google Slides webpage and browse to find the slides you have prepared.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-google-slides-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="Share slides on Google Meet  "                ></p><ol><li>Open Google Meet on your browser and go on to the meeting link page. Here you have two options, one - you can join the session directly and then start presenting the screen, or two - share the screen and then join the session.</li></ol><p>If you decide to go with the latter option, then click the “Present” option. Since I’m using the Chrome browser, I will choose the slides tab to share. If you would like to share any audio, make sure to tick the share tab audio button as well!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-google-slides-tab-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="Share slides on Google Meet  "                ></p><ol><li>Once you have gone through these steps your Google Slides will automatically be visible to anyone and everyone in the Google Meet session.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Present-PowerPoint-or-Slides-in-Google-Meet-On-iPhone-and-iPad"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Present-PowerPoint-or-Slides-in-Google-Meet-On-iPhone-and-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Present PowerPoint or Slides in Google Meet On iPhone and iPad?"></a>Part 3: How to Present PowerPoint or Slides in Google Meet On iPhone and iPad?</h2><p>Wondering <strong>how to present ppt in Google Meet in iPhone</strong>? Well, don’t worry because even with a mobile or tablet you can access all the Google Meet features, even screen share!</p><p>Step 1) Open your PowerPoint or Slides on your iPhone or iPad, and then join the Google Meet meeting.</p><p>Step 2) To start sharing your screen, press the three-button icon which appears in the bottom right corner of your screen, and then tap the <strong>Share Screen</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-powerpoint-on-google-meet-iphone.jpg"                      alt="Share slides on Google Meet on iPhone "                ></p><p> Step 3) After doing so, the presenter will see a notification on their screen allowing them to broadcast their entire screen. Upon clicking “Start Broadcast” the screen will start to share in three seconds.

Just because an individual starts presenting, their camera will not turn off automatically, unless it is turned off by them.</p><ol><li><strong>Can participants interact with your device while sharing a presentation?</strong></li></ol><p>No, participants cannot interact with your device while sharing a presentation. The screen is only being mirrored, therefore only the presenter has control over the device. Participants can only view it, not control the device.</p><ol><li><strong>Can you present when someone else is presenting?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, an individual can present when someone else is presenting. If you start presenting while someone else is already presenting, their screen presenting will pause and yours will start.</p><p><strong>Are You Ready to Present PPT on Google Meet?</strong></p><p>Presenting a ppt on Google Meet is not all that difficult, if you know what to do, how to do it, and when to do it, then you are good to go. Google Meet is a video conferencing tool created to ease virtual communication and make it more functional. So, if you were wondering <strong>how to share slides in Google Meet</strong>, well we hope you got the answer!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Huawei’s Smartphones enable you to accomplish both of these tasks in just a few simple steps. However, the built-in Screen Recorder on Huawei’s Mate 10, 20 P20 or P10 Android devices doesn’t allow you to specify the region of the screen you want to capture or select the frame rate, so if you want to gain access to more powerful screen recording tools you should install an app such as AZ Screen Recorder or DU Recorder from the Google Play Store, but you can also record the screen on the computer with some desktop screen recorders.

    <updated>2024-09-03T07:33:43.891Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Recording-Titans-Duel"><a href="#Recording-Titans-Duel" class="headerlink" title="Recording Titans Duel"></a>Recording Titans Duel</h2><p>When it comes to live streaming on video platforms like YouTube or Twitch from your desktop, you will need a live streaming software. Among live video streaming software, OBS Studio and Streamlabs Desktop clearly stand out. They are popular because they are completely free to use and they have all the necessary features a video streamer desire.</p><p>Not just live streaming on any online platform, they software applications also let you record your live streams, record your computer screen as well as webcam. Now the question arises whether to choose Streamlabs or OBS Studio. We will help you out in your decision making by providing a thorough comparison of OBS vs Streamlabs parameter by parameter.</p><h2 id="1-About-OBS-Studio"><a href="#1-About-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1. About OBS Studio"></a>1. About OBS Studio</h2><p>Here are all the details of OBS Studio that you will help you compare OBS with Streamlabs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-pros-and-cons.jpg"                      alt="obs pros and cons"                ></p><p>Performance:</p><p>OBS Studio is designed for multi-tasking. You can live stream as well as record your video. You can capture your screen as well as webcam video simultaneously. In fact, it supports capturing video from various external devices. For regular video recording and streaming, the performance of OBS is top-notch. It does not affect the performance of your streaming or gameplay.</p><p>However, when you have extremely high-quality video playing on your screen or you are playing high-end games that you want to record, OBS Studio tends to consume excessive CPU resources. Therefore, OBS Studio is suitable for regular quality streaming and recording and it might crash if your computer configuration is not top-notch.</p><p>Recording:</p><p>If you are comparing OBS vs Streamlabs for recording, OBS is a clear winner. This is because OBS Studio heavily focuses on recording features while Streamlabs focuses on live streaming broadly. You can record video from any external device, you can modify recording quality, and you can switch between multiple scenes as required. It also comes with filters for color correction, chroma key, and masking for better recording.</p><p>Streaming:</p><p>OBS Studio is the most popular live streaming platform and this is due to its wide compatibility. Once you have Stream URL and Stream key, you can literally stream on any and all online platforms that allow live streaming. Starting from Twitch, YouTube and Facebook to even Instagram and Twitter, you can stream on all popular and not-so-popular platforms directly from your desktop.</p><p>Ease Of Use:</p><p>OBS can be a bit complicated to use for beginners. This is because the user interface is not as clean and intuitive as you would expect. However, once you start using the software for some time, you will get used to the controls and options. But the learning curve is rather steep and that is why many users opt for OBS alternatives. For ease of use, OBS Studio has loads of hotkeys through which you can perform all the different operations instantly.</p><p>Video Quality:</p><p>OBS Studio lets you customize the video quality as per your requirements. You can capture 4K video depending on your screen resolution or camera resolution. However, OBS automatically lowers the frame rate as the resolution of the video goes up which is not desirable.

These might be due to unmanaged positioning of the hardware devices, improper configurations of the <strong>Zoom audio settings</strong>, or both. Some of the most common Zoom audio problems and their possible solutions are discussed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-audio-advanced-settings.jpg"                      alt=" Zoom Meeting Settings Advanced Audio Settings "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997817/17059" target="_top" id="1997817"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-1997817"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997817/17059"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-1-Audio-Feedback-Loop"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-1-Audio-Feedback-Loop" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 1: Audio Feedback Loop"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 1: Audio Feedback Loop</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It"><a href="#What-Is-It" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p>Audio feedback loop is when your voice keeps repeating itself for an indefinite number of times and never stops whatsoever.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >6 Top Voice Changer for Zoom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h5 id="How-It-Happens"><a href="#How-It-Happens" class="headerlink" title="How It Happens?"></a>How It Happens?</h5><p>When you are using external speakers and microphone, and both are placed nearby, any sound that comes out of the speaker is received by the microphone. If Zoom is configured to accept sounds from system audio, the mic sends the signals back to the speakers that again send the audio output to the mic. Since this iteration never ends, you continuously hear an audio feedback loop.</p><h5 id="How-to-Resolve-the-Audio-Loop-in-Zoom-Meeting"><a href="#How-to-Resolve-the-Audio-Loop-in-Zoom-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to Resolve the Audio Loop in Zoom Meeting?"></a>How to Resolve the Audio Loop in Zoom Meeting?</h5><p>In order to eliminate this issue, make sure to place both microphone and speakers at a safe distance from each other. This would prevent the microphone from receiving any output from the speakers, and the chain of audio feedback loop would never take place.</p><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-2-Background-Noise"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-2-Background-Noise" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 2: Background Noise"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 2: Background Noise</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It-1"><a href="#What-Is-It-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p>Background noise is the distortion or humming that you hear during an audio call on zoom.</p><h5 id="Why-I-hear-background-noise-in-Zoom-Meeting"><a href="#Why-I-hear-background-noise-in-Zoom-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Why I hear background noise in Zoom Meeting?"></a>Why I hear background noise in Zoom Meeting?</h5><p>If you have a highly sensitive microphone that is mostly used by professionals or in recording studios, the chances are that it will catch a lot of background noise during a Zoom meeting.</p><h5 id="How-to-remove-the-background-noise-in-Zoom-meeting"><a href="#How-to-remove-the-background-noise-in-Zoom-meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to remove the background noise in Zoom meeting?"></a>How to remove the background noise in Zoom meeting?</h5><p>This issue can be resolved by either hosting or joining a meeting in a closed, soundproof room, or using a less sensitive mic. It would be best if you use a normal headset that is easily available in any local electronic shop. You can also try enabling the <strong>Automatically adjust volume</strong> option from the <strong>Microphone</strong> section of the <strong>Audio</strong> category of the <strong>Settings</strong> box as explained earlier in <strong>Step 3</strong> of the <strong>Zoom Audio Settings When Not in Meeting</strong> section.</p><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-3-Echo"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-3-Echo" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 3: Echo"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 3: Echo</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It-2"><a href="#What-Is-It-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p><strong>Zoom audio echo</strong> is when you hear an echo sound during an ongoing Zoom meeting with audio enabled.</p><h5 id="How-It-Happens-1"><a href="#How-It-Happens-1" class="headerlink" title="How It Happens?"></a>How It Happens?</h5><p>Echo happens when you are on a laptop and are using onboard speakers and microphone, and that too with the speaker or mic volume set to maximum.</p><h5 id="How-to-remove-the-echo-in-the-Zoom-meeting"><a href="#How-to-remove-the-echo-in-the-Zoom-meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to remove the echo in the Zoom meeting?"></a>How to remove the echo in the Zoom meeting?</h5><p>As mentioned earlier, it is always advisable to use a headset to avoid any such unwanted echo or audio feedback loop issues. In case you don’t have access to a headset, try configuring the microphone settings to automatically adjust the volume, and not putting the speaker volume to the max.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Configuring <strong>Zoom audio settings</strong> before hosting or joining a meeting is always a wise approach to avoid any audio inconsistencies during an ongoing conference. However, if you are already in one, you can use the methods given above to configure the microphone settings to get the audio right. You are also encouraged to use an average quality headset during a Zoom meeting to avoid any <strong>Zoom audio echo</strong>, feedback loop, or background noises.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Improve Video Quality in Zoom Meetings? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://martinic.evyy.net/c/5597632/1422856/4482" target="_top" id="1422856"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4482-1422856"                      border="0" alt="" width="580" height="309"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-audio-archive-checkout-and-scrutiny/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Audio Archive Checkout & Scrutiny</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-pixelated-palace-beginner-friendly-home-design-guide/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Pixelated Palace  Beginner-Friendly Home Design Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-resounding-beats-audio-studio-mac/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Resounding Beats  Audio Studio Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-screen-capture-expertise-3-cost-free-methods/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Screen Capture Expertise  3 Cost-Free Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-streamlinedwebcamtechniqueinstruction/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  StreamlinedWebCamTechniqueInstruction</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-setting-up-a-group-conversation-that-caters-to-all-systems-in-skype/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  The Ultimate Guide to Setting up a Group Conversation that Caters to All Systems in Skype</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-vidma-to-go-screen-record-and-beyond-alternatives/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Vidma to Go  Screen Record and Beyond Alternatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-compile-presentation-asset-to-video-for-2024/"><u>[New] Compile Presentation Asset to Video for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-correct-obs-blackout-error-in-gaming-capture/"><u>[New] Correct OBS Blackout Error in Gaming Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-decision-time-choose-your-dream-video-editor-filmora-or-democracy-creator-for-2024/"><u>[New] Decision Time!

If you’d like to find out more about making video tutorials you’ve come to the right place because, in this guide, we will take you through each step of how to make a video tutorial. So let’s get started.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Preparing Before Making Video Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Using Right Screen Recording Software for Step-by-Step Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Recording Professional Audio</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Capturing Tutorial Video</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Editing Recorded Tutorial Video</a></li><li><a href="#part6">Sharing the Video Tutorial With Your Audiences</a></li><li><a href="#part7">Summary for Next Tutorial Video</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Preparing-for-the-Tutorial-Making-Process-3-Tips"><a href="#Part-1-Preparing-for-the-Tutorial-Making-Process-3-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Preparing for the Tutorial Making Process [3 Tips]"></a>Part 1: Preparing for the Tutorial Making Process [3 Tips]</h2><p>The amount of video content uploaded to the Internet on a daily basis is staggering, to say the least. That’s why your video tutorials need to offer something unique in order to stand out in the sea of similar content. The process of making a tutorial starts long before you hit the record button, and here are a few tips that will help you be prepared for the challenges you might face while making your first video tutorial.</p><h4 id="1-Define-the-Target-Audience-and-Pick-the-Right-Topics"><a href="#1-Define-the-Target-Audience-and-Pick-the-Right-Topics" class="headerlink" title="1. Define the Target Audience and Pick the Right Topics"></a>1. Define the Target Audience and Pick the Right Topics</h4><p>Who are the people you are trying to reach? Finding the answer to this simple question is going to help you solve a variety of common issues video content producers have to deal with. By defining the target audience you’ll be able to discover the best way to approach them.</p><p>What’s more, once you understand who the viewers of your tutorials are, you’ll be able to pick the subjects that spark the most interest within the group you’re targeting. It goes without saying that knowing everything there is to know about the topics you’re covering is an absolute must if you are hoping to attract large audiences to your videos.</p><h4 id="2-Make-a-Content-Plan"><a href="#2-Make-a-Content-Plan" class="headerlink" title="2. Make a Content Plan"></a>2. Make a Content Plan</h4><p>The best way to approach the process of tutorial video production is to define your goals and the course of action long before you start recording. You should write down all the ideas and concepts you have in your head. Once you’ve formulated the concept you’ll be able to see how many videos you have to make in order to cover all the ins and outs of a topic.</p><p>Try to find natural stopping points or thematic units in your list and decide how many videos you’ll have to create so you can offer a comprehensive and informative view on the subject. Including too much information in one video may discourage the viewers to follow the tutorial until the end. You should take into consideration the concept of the cognitive load while deciding how long your videos should be. This concept points out that there’s a limit to how much and how fast an average person can learn, so offering too much information in a single video can end up being counterproductive.</p><p>If the topic of your video tutorial is complex you should provide explanations through practical examples, even if it takes a lot of screen time, rather than jumping from one subject to another. Here are a few tips that will help you figure out how to structure your video tutorial series.</p><p><strong>Your concept must have a clear beginning, middle and the end:</strong> This is a basic rule of storytelling that helps you guide the viewer through the topic of your tutorials. You should use the same principle when recording each video in the series.</p><p><strong>How much time a certain topic demands:</strong> Covering more than one topic in a video is possible, although before you decide to do so, you should make sure that the topics you want to include in the tutorial have something in common.</p><p><strong>How much information is too much:</strong> Keeping the viewer’s attention glued to what’s going on in the tutorial is your primary goal. That’s why you need to find the right measure of information you provide in each video. By offering less information in each video, you’re giving viewers the time to process it and understand it better.</p><p>Once you’ve created thematic units you can proceed to write a script for each video. These scripts don’t have to be detailed, you can just create a few bullet points to guide you through the video.</p><h4 id="3-Record-in-a-Clean-Work-Environment"><a href="#3-Record-in-a-Clean-Work-Environment" class="headerlink" title="3. Record in a Clean Work Environment"></a>3. Record in a Clean Work Environment</h4><p>Everything displayed on your computer’s monitor is going to be recorded, so before you start a screen capturing session make sure that all of your private data is well outside the work environment you’ll be using in the video. Instead of wasting time on concealing private information in the post-production, you can save time by controlling what is visible in the portion of the screen you are capturing.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Choosing-Best-Screen-Recorder-for-Video-Tutorial-Making"><a href="#Part-2-Choosing-Best-Screen-Recorder-for-Video-Tutorial-Making" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Choosing Best Screen Recorder for Video Tutorial Making"></a>Part 2: Choosing <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for Video Tutorial Making</h2><p>Having the right tools for a job is as equally important as knowing exactly how to do a certain job. There are so many different screen recorders on the market at the moment, that choosing the right one isn’t always such an easy task. Most free software products that offer the screencasting feature have limitations that may prevent you from creating a high-quality tutorial.</p><p>If you want to capture videos at high frame rates, select the region of the screen you’re recording by yourself or record high-resolution footage we recommend using Wondershare’s <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Scrn <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Besides featuring powerful screen capturing tools, the software also has a video editing mode, that allows you to edit your videos immediately after you finish a screencasting session. You can use this software to record all your desktop activities on Mac and PC computers for free, and you can purchase the perpetual license to use it for just $29.99 or a one-year license at $19.99.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4081991&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/wt-500x500.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Audio-Recording-A-Few-Tips-for-Recording-Better-Audio"><a href="#Part-3-Audio-Recording-A-Few-Tips-for-Recording-Better-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Audio Recording: A Few Tips for Recording Better Audio"></a>Part 3: Audio Recording: A Few Tips for Recording Better Audio</h2><p>Video tutorials largely depend on narration, because you have to use your voice to explain what is going on in the video. That’s why you have to pay special attention to the quality of sound in your videos. Tutorials with poor audio quality have fewer chances of attracting large audiences, simply because most people don’t want to watch a video if they can’t understand what you are saying. Here’s how you can improve the quality of audio in your video tutorials.</p><h4 id="1-Use-the-right-Microphone"><a href="#1-Use-the-right-Microphone" class="headerlink" title="1. Use the right Microphone"></a>1. Use the right <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Whether or not you should record audio with an external microphone is not the real question you should be asking. The real issue is which type of external microphone you should use. Omnidirectional microphones pick up background noises easily, so in order to record clear and natural narration, you should use a unidirectional microphone that only picks up sounds that are coming from one direction.</p><h4 id="2-Add-Background-Music-if-necessary"><a href="#2-Add-Background-Music-if-necessary" class="headerlink" title="2.Add Background Music if necessary"></a>2.<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Add Background Music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if necessary</h4><p>Music can help you create a pleasant atmosphere in your video tutorials and it can partially cover the background noise. There are numerous websites that grant you access to royalty free music, which means that it shouldn’t be too hard to find the track you want to include in the tutorial. You should just make sure that the voiceover is clearly audible because you don’t want the music to be louder than the narrator’s voice.</p><h4 id="3-Record-in-an-optimized-acoustic-environment"><a href="#3-Record-in-an-optimized-acoustic-environment" class="headerlink" title="3. Record in an optimized acoustic environment"></a>3. Record in an optimized acoustic environment</h4><p>Sometimes background noise can completely destroy the audio recording you captured. So, in order to avoid this turn off all home appliances that create atmospheric noises. In addition, the room in which you are recording should have great acoustics, because even the slightest reverb can influence the sound quality.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Capturing-a-Video-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-4-Capturing-a-Video-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Capturing a Video Tutorial"></a>Part 4: Capturing a Video Tutorial</h2><p>Note: There are so many screen recording software available on the market as we described before. But here, we will take Filmora Scrn as an example.</p><p>Once you’ve prepared a clean working environment, attached the external microphone to your computer, it is time to start your first screencasting session. You can begin by launching <strong>Filmora Scrn</strong> and selecting the <strong>Quick Capture</strong> option from the software’s welcome window.</p><h4 id="1-Designate-the-region-of-the-screen-you’d-like-to-capture"><a href="#1-Designate-the-region-of-the-screen-you’d-like-to-capture" class="headerlink" title="1.

If you’d like to remove just a couple of frames, you can just drag one end of the clip and get rid of the unwanted material.</p><h4 id="2-Speed-up-parts-of-the-clip-that-are-not-important"><a href="#2-Speed-up-parts-of-the-clip-that-are-not-important" class="headerlink" title="2. Speed up parts of the clip that are not important"></a>2. Speed up parts of the clip that are not important</h4><p>Time is of the essence in each video tutorial you create because the viewers might get bored if some parts of the video are too long. You can easily solve this problem by speeding up portions of the video that don’t contain vital information. Just click on the clip on the timeline to select it and head over to the Transform menu on the right side of the Filmora Scrn’s editor. Locate the Speed menu and insert the new value into the Speed box.</p><h4 id="3-Zoom-in-on-important-info"><a href="#3-Zoom-in-on-important-info" class="headerlink" title="3. Zoom in on important info"></a>3. Zoom in on important info</h4><p>Tutorials often contain a lot of information, so if you’d like to highlight something you find important, simply use the zoom in feature.</p><h4 id="4-Add-transitions"><a href="#4-Add-transitions" class="headerlink" title="4. Add transitions"></a>4. Add transitions</h4><p>Jumping from one shot to the other can be visually unpleasant. Fortunately, you can insert transitions and make switching between shots much smoother. All you have to do is head over to the Transitions folder and drag the transition you like to the appropriate spot on the timeline.</p><h4 id="5-Use-Effects-and-Callouts"><a href="#5-Use-Effects-and-Callouts" class="headerlink" title="5. Use Effects and Callouts"></a>5. Use Effects and Callouts</h4><p>Most video editing software products, including Filmora Scrn, provide a lot of effects that can make your video tutorials more visually attractive. Furthermore, you can add callouts if you want to draw the viewer’s attention to a, particularly important detail.</p><h4 id="6-Add-text-boxes-to-guide-your-viewers"><a href="#6-Add-text-boxes-to-guide-your-viewers" class="headerlink" title="6. Add text boxes to guide your viewers"></a>6. Add text boxes to guide your viewers</h4><p>You can easily provide information about your upcoming video tutorials by adding text overlays to your videos. You just have to select the font, size, or color of the text and find the best place for it on the screen. Try to keep text you use in a video as short as possible, because too much text may distract the viewer.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Sharing-the-Video-Tutorial-With-Your-Audiences"><a href="#Part-6-Sharing-the-Video-Tutorial-With-Your-Audiences" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Sharing the Video Tutorial With Your Audiences"></a>Part 6: Sharing the Video Tutorial With Your Audiences</h2><p>After you’ve completed the video editing process, you should export the video in a file format that can be easily be uploaded to the Internet.</p><h4 id="1-Where-to-upload-a-video-tutorial"><a href="#1-Where-to-upload-a-video-tutorial" class="headerlink" title="1. Where to upload a video tutorial?"></a>1. Where to upload a video tutorial?</h4><p>The most obvious choice is YouTube because it is the world’s largest video sharing platform. However, options such as Vimeo or even Facebook may produce equally impressive results. The eLearning websites, like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Udemy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or <a class="link"   href="https://www.skillshare.com/" >Skillshare <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are also worth considering if your plan is to produce video tutorials on a professional level.</p><h4 id="2-Optimize-the-video-description"><a href="#2-Optimize-the-video-description" class="headerlink" title="2. Optimize the video description"></a>2. Optimize the video description</h4><p>Using keywords in the video description will secure better search results. Choose keywords that are directly related to the topic your video is covering, because you will gain nothing if the video appears in search results for unrelated subjects. There are a lot of different tools online you can use to discover the best keywords for your video tutorials, including the Google AdWords Keyword Planner Tool.</p><h4 id="3-Write-a-related-blog-post"><a href="#3-Write-a-related-blog-post" class="headerlink" title="3. Write a related blog post"></a>3. Write a related blog post</h4><p>One of the best ways to promote your video tutorials is to write blogs about the topics you are covering because you can use the videos to offer more info about the subject. That way you’ll direct readers towards the tutorial and you’ll be able to generate more traffic.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Summarize-and-Improve-for-Next-Video-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-7-Summarize-and-Improve-for-Next-Video-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Summarize and Improve for Next Video Tutorial"></a>Part 7: Summarize and Improve for Next Video Tutorial</h2><p>Don’t expect your first video tutorial to be a major success, that’s going to attract millions of views. But what you can do is keep track of the number of hits the video got, pay attention to the comments, suggestions or critique and try to do better in the next video. There are many different tools you can use to monitor a video’s performance, including YouTube Analytics if you’re using this platform.</p><p>Developing your video making skills and using the feedback you get to increase the quality of the content you’re producing is probably the most important aspect of the entire process. Failing to find ways to improve the video tutorials you’re making may result in a low number of views and their overall poor performance on the Internet, so you should do everything in your power to constantly find new ways of reaching new audiences and delivering high-quality tutorials to your audience.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The process of creating a video tutorial is rather simple since you only have to designate the region of the screen you’d like to capture, make sure that the microphone is functioning properly and hit the record button. The Internet offers plenty of opportunities to share your work with millions of people and to help them learn new skills or solve problems that are preventing them from moving forward in their careers. So, develop your content plan and start making your video tutorials. Was the information we provided useful?

Razer Kiyo Design</h4><p>At a glance, you will find its basic design same as most webcams in the market, but Razer Kiyo has actually added something new to this unit with its amazing craftsmanship. Looking at the closed camera, you will find three discs lying on one another; they are a light ring, the camera unit and two hinges for adjusting the device on laptop or desktop monitor.
