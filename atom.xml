Understand that Stardew Valley is regarded as a simulation role-playing video game. This video game was developed by no one else but Eric Barone. While it was released in February 2016 for Microsoft Windows, it later made its debut in:</p><ul><li>Xbox one</li><li>PlayStation Vita</li><li>iOS</li><li>Android</li><li>MacOS</li><li>Linux, and even;</li><li>PlayStation 4</li></ul><p>Are you wondering what makes this game interesting? Well, players tend to act as a character who takes complete control over their late grandfather’s already dilapidated farm. And, this farm is located in a place known as Stardew Valley. It must be noted that this game is entirely open-ended as it enables players to take on diverse activities. These activities include:</p><ul><li>Ore mining</li><li>Growing of crops</li><li>Raising some livestock</li><li>Selling of produce, and;</li><li>Crafting of goods</li></ul><p>More so, your character will get to socialize with the people in the town, proceed to marry, and even have kids. Note that roughly three other players can play this game together online. In other news, Stardew Valley has been regarded over time as a masterpiece. It is filled with a relaxing vibe, romance, and, of course, adventure.</p><p>For those interested, the game begins with you, a box of parsnip seeds, and some handy tools. Bear in mind that Stardew Valley has a lot to offer its players. And, the addition of Ginger Island has made the game very popular. Understand that with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, players have begun new farms and are trying to grow tropical produce to make a profit. If you never knew, Stardew Valley Ginger Island is filled with fun activities as well as puzzles.</p><h2 id="Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island"><a href="#Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island" class="headerlink" title="Stardew Valley Ginger Island"></a><strong>Stardew Valley Ginger Island</strong></h2><p>It must be clearly stated that Stardew Valley Ginger Island is where the majority of the new content of Stardew Valley takes place. If you never knew, the 1.5 update of Stardew Valley has a whole lot to offer, ranging from new items, areas, places to build your farm, and even some new characters.</p><p>Above all, Ginger Island is most likely the most significant part of the Stardew Valley 1.5 update. For those who are just starting with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, things may get quite awkward. However, those who already play the Stardew Valley game will be capable of venturing into the quests and solving them. To proceed to Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you will need to restore the community center. Note that this particular task will get players closer to being capable of visiting Ginger Island. However, to restore the community center, you will need to create bundles for no one else but the Junimos. The Junimos are found living inside the community center. By creating all the bundles for the Junimos, they will assist you in restoring the community center. When you are done repairing the community center, you will need to be capable of helping Willy fix his already old boat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-location.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-location"                ></p><p>Immediately you meet the requirements of restoring the community center and fixing willy’s boat. When you get to the Ginger Island while playing the Stardew Valley Ginger Island game, you will meet Leo. The first thing to know about Leo is that he is a shy person though he is not interested in the player. As a shy person, he befriends both animals and players subtly. When he befriends you, he can begin considering making a move into town. The move to town will make Leo more accessible. In all, Leo is simply a child that will manage to successfully befriend Jas and Vincent whenever he is fully settled in the new home in the Stardew Valley Ginger Island game.</p><h2 id="Features-in-Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island"><a href="#Features-in-Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island" class="headerlink" title="Features in Stardew Valley Ginger Island"></a><strong>Features in Stardew Valley Ginger Island</strong></h2><p>Some of the intriguing addition players will love in Stardew Valley Ginger Island include:</p><h3 id="1-Volcano-dungeon"><a href="#1-Volcano-dungeon" class="headerlink" title="1.Volcano dungeon"></a>1.Volcano dungeon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-volcano-dungeon.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-volcano-dungeon"                ></p><p>This is regarded as an enormous draw for adventurous players. It is lava-filled, and players will encounter nine new enemies, lots of new items, a shop, and a forge. Please do not mistake the Volcano dungeon for the skull cavern as they fi crib differently. If you want to pass through the Volcano dungeon successfully, you will need to solve some puzzles. Also, you will need to make use of the watering can to traverse the lava successfully.</p><h3 id="2-The-Island-trader"><a href="#2-The-Island-trader" class="headerlink" title="2.The Island trader"></a>2.The Island trader</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-the-island-trader.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-the-island-trader"                ></p><p>Among the first things, every farmer will have on their to-do list is to get a hold of some elements on the Island.

When they are dug, the fossils are carried to Dr. Snail and further donated. When you complete the fossils, you will be given golden walnuts. The golden walnuts take the role of currency of the Stardew Valley Ginger Island game.</p><h3 id="5-Dig-site"><a href="#5-Dig-site" class="headerlink" title="5.Dig site"></a>5.Dig site</h3><p>It is practically a tropical version of the quarry but with some quirks. You will find a mushroom cave positioned near it. And when you are inside, you will find the NPC, Dr. Snail. Bear in mind that this site is capable of spawning mahogany trees and nodes daily. It makes it suitable for farming. When you free Dr. Snail from this vicinity, the Island field office will be unlocked, and the power to donate fossils will be provided.</p><h3 id="6-New-farm"><a href="#6-New-farm" class="headerlink" title="6.New farm"></a>6.New farm</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-new-farm.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-new-farm"                ></p><p>If you love the tropical vibe of Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you can get to settle there.

These activities include:</p><ul><li>Ore mining</li><li>Growing of crops</li><li>Raising some livestock</li><li>Selling of produce, and;</li><li>Crafting of goods</li></ul><p>More so, your character will get to socialize with the people in the town, proceed to marry, and even have kids.

For those who are just starting with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, things may get quite awkward.

To proceed to Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you will need to restore the community center. Note that this particular task will get players closer to being capable of visiting Ginger Island. However, to restore the community center, you will need to create bundles for no one else but the Junimos. The Junimos are found living inside the community center.

Key Features of SplitCam"></a>2. Key Features of SplitCam</h2><p>Even though it is a completely free video recorder, there are loads of useful features for the users. Here are the key features of SplitCam that you should be aware of.</p><p>Record From Different Sources – You can record webcam video, desktop screen, IP camera, web browser screen, as well as your gameplay. Besides, you can record audio from different sources. In fact, you can record another video, image, PDF document, slideshow, and much more in the background.</p><p>Video Effects – There are loads of video effects available to apply to webcam videos.

Besides, SplitCam allows you to use webcam with several applications without any issue. You can also upload your video to YouTube instantly.</p><p>Useful Features: The zoom feature is really great for highlighting the needed part. When you are making explanatory video, the zooming feature is a necessity for everyone to focus on the right part. Besides, you can capture screenshots instead of video as well. The software also shows the performance parameters for better understanding.</p><p>HD recording – SplitCam lets you record the desired video from any video source as per the video resolution you need.

In-depth Review"></a>3. In-depth Review</h2><p>Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.</p><p>Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.</p><p>Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.</p><p>Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p><p>Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.</p><h2 id="4-Best-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Spatial-Symphony-with-Mac-Recording"><a href="#Spatial-Symphony-with-Mac-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Spatial Symphony with Mac Recording"></a>Spatial Symphony with Mac Recording</h2><p>Sound Studio is one of the industry-leading audio recording software that has millions of downloads over different app stores and platforms. The application is specifically designed to match the high performance of MacBooks with the macOS support. The interface inside the application is handy with a bunch of tools for utilizing every aspect of sound recording. With Sound Studio you will feel almost like sitting in a record room with professional hardware.</p><p>The app even lets you digitalize any of the records from tapes as well as vinyl records and also lets you record any live performances that are going on with high-quality audio output. The equalizer in the application has dozens of features that will allow you to mix any of your recordings with background tracks, voice-overs, and many more digital effects. Here’s more about it:</p><h2 id="Part-1-Key-features-of-Sound-Studio"><a href="#Part-1-Key-features-of-Sound-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Key features of Sound Studio"></a>Part 1. Key features of Sound Studio</h2><p>If you are looking for powerful recording software that can give you industry-leading features, then Sound Studio is the best choice for you. It is specifically designed to provide an ultimate user experience with fewer complications and the highest quality output. And with the new updated version from Sound Studio, you will have even more functions on your lap. The following are some of the best features of the Sound Studio application:</p><p><strong>1. High-quality music output</strong></p><p>One of the basic requirements for any audio recorder is that the output quality for the recorded files must be crystal clear and shouldn’t be of low quality. And Sound Studio meets all these aspects in voice recording by providing its users HD quality output sounds with simple and easy steps.</p><p><strong>2. Multiple formats support</strong></p><p>The application is also enabled with multiple audio format supports which means that there are several formats in which you can create your record as well as export it. You can work with voice recordings from MP3 or M4A files and then you can save them in different formats such as AIDD and WAV.</p><p><strong>3. Fast and convenient editing</strong></p><p>The user interface along with the software integration of macOS gives Sound Studio a very fast yet convenient editing studio feature. In this section, you will be able to create your audio in several layers and save it with different digital effects such as reverb, delays, chorus, or even flange filters.</p><p><strong>4. Digital conversion</strong></p><p>The application also allows the users to visit their memory lane by helping them digitize the tapes as well as vinyl records from their PC itself. In this way, everyone can save their old dusty records into digital formats which will enable them to modify the voice configurations and then edit them with different layers of effects.</p><p><strong>5. Batch processing using AppleScript or Automator</strong></p><p>For people who want to process their audio in a batch or want to combine different audio recordings at the same time, they can use the AppleScript or any Automator for the same since Sound Studio supports the integration of both thus enabling a more powerful part of audio processing.</p><p><strong>6. Live performance recording</strong></p><p>There are situations where we want to record the ongoing live performances from our systems and in such scenarios, Sound Studio can help you efficiently. With built-in live recording mode, you can record the live performances from voice actors almost instantly with the push of a few buttons on your system.</p><p><strong>7. Digital noise cancellation</strong></p><p>The application also cancels out the extra and unnecessary voices from the background after you record any voice in the Sound Studio. Thus, when you play it with enabling the digital noise cancellation feature, you will be able to listen to clear sound without any disruption from the outside world.</p><p><strong>8. Regular updates</strong></p><p>Updates are the most important things for any software since the developers provide a clean experience with each new update and try to remove the bugs and issues reported by users. Also, Sound Studio developers provide regular updates to all their users with just a one-time subscription.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Record-Audio-with-Sound-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Record-Audio-with-Sound-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Simplify-Tech-Sharing-Effective-Use-of-the-Ezvide-Toolkit"><a href="#Simplify-Tech-Sharing-Effective-Use-of-the-Ezvide-Toolkit" class="headerlink" title="Simplify Tech Sharing: Effective Use of the Ezvide Toolkit"></a>Simplify Tech Sharing: Effective Use of the Ezvide Toolkit</h2><p>Ezvid is a popular screen recording and video editing software. With the emergence of video streaming and social media platforms, there has been an exponential rise in the number of video creators. Every video creator needs a professional video editing and screen recording software so that their video is of top-notch quality to get the attention of the viewers instantly. That is exactly why Ezvid is popular, as it provides a perfect for recording and editing. Ezvid comes with a user-friendly interface unlike many professional video editing and recording software.</p><p>You can capture anything on your screen such as games, browser activities as well as desktop activities. You can also record Facecam and add voiceover. Starting from adding instant effects and drawing on the screen to control video speed control and adding free music, there is no dearth of features and options. However, is <strong>Ezvid screen recorder</strong> the best software available or is there a better alternative you can opt for? In this article, we will explain the features of Ezvid and how to use Ezvid recorder. Thereafter, we will recommend a better alternative tool for screen recording.</p><p>Part 1. <a href="#part1">Key Features of Ezvid</a></p><p>Part 2. <a href="#part2">How to Use Ezvid Screen Recorder</a></p><p>Part 3. <a href="#part3">Alternative Tool to Record Screen</a></p><h2 id="1-Key-Features-of-Ezvid"><a href="#1-Key-Features-of-Ezvid" class="headerlink" title="1. Key Features of Ezvid"></a>1. Key Features of Ezvid</h2><p>Ezvid video maker is a great screen recording software and here are the features that the software has to offer to satisfy all the requirements of the video creators.</p><p><strong>Record Screen and Facecam</strong></p><p>Ezvid is an incredible screen recorder to capture your desktop screen as well as browser screen. The user interface is clean and there is a direct option available to start recording the entire screen. Moreover, there are advanced options available such as capturing a region of the screen instead of the entire screen.</p><p>Besides, you can record Facecam which is extremely important for video creators who show the screen as well as their face on the same video simultaneously. This makes the video more relatable and professional. Therefore, apart from recording the entire or part of the screen, you can record from the webcam and both the capturing is put together in the same video.</p><p><strong>Instant Screen Drawing</strong></p><p>Instead of waiting for the screen recording to get over and editing the recorded video to add drawings, you can add the required drawings live while recording the screen with Ezvid screen recorder. This simple feature is going to save you a lot of time as there is no further editing required. There are ample drawings available to illustrate on the screen and draw the attention of the viewers in the highlighted areas.</p><p><strong>Gameplay Recording</strong></p><p>Apart from recording desktop screen as well as browser screen, there is a special and dedicated feature to capture the screen while playing games. The software comes with guided instructions on how to record gameplay for complete user convenience. Professional gamers may not get all the customization options but Ezvid gets the job done perfectly. After recording the game screen, you can edit the video and upload it on social media and video streaming platforms.</p><p><strong>Free Music Addition</strong></p><p>One of the main reasons why a good-quality video stands out from a basic video is the background music. You will find only a few screen recorders and video editors to add free music in the background of the video as per your preference and requirements. This makes the video soothing and pleasant to the ears rather than just being pleasant to the eyes. There is no need to search online for free music to add to your screen recordings as you can find suitable music for your video from Ezvid library.</p><p><strong>Control Video Speed</strong></p><p>You know how important it is to regulate video speed so that the crucial moments are recorded at a slow speed while not so important parts can be at a high speed. There are only a few screen recorders available that allow users to control video speed. This is a necessary feature professional video creators always look for in a screen recording and video editing software.</p><p><strong>Instant Slideshow Maker -</strong></p><p>Instead of making and editing videos all the time, you can also use Ezvid to make slideshows using screenshots and photos. There are beautiful transitions and effects available and you can add texts and drawings. You can make the slideshows instantly and share them with anyone on any platform. Therefore, Ezvid video maker can be used as a screen recorder as well as slideshow maker.</p><p>Besides, you can add voice over to the recorded video to make it more professional and interesting.</p><h2 id="2-How-to-Use-Ezvid-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#2-How-to-Use-Ezvid-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Use Ezvid Screen Recorder"></a>2. How to Use Ezvid Screen Recorder</h2><p>Ezvid screen recorder is easy to use and it is perfect for beginners as well. It is important to note that Ezvid is available only for Windows users. If you are using Mac, you can check out the best alternative in the next section. Ezvid for Windows is compatible with Windows XP to Windows 10. Here are the steps to follow to record the screen with Ezvid.</p><p>Step 1: Download and Install Ezvid from the official website of Ezvid for Windows.</p><p>Step 2: Launch Ezvid and click on Capture Screen option (monitor icon) located at the bottom-right corner as you can see on the screenshot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ezvid-screen-capture.jpg"                      alt="run ezvid recorder"                ></p><p>Step 3: This will start recording the entire screen. If you want to stop recording, you have to click on Stop button. You can also cancel the recording by clicking on “X” icon.</p><p>Note: You can also drag and dump any video on Ezvid for editing purposes.</p><p>Step 4: Once you stop the recording, the recorded video will show up with its timeline. If you want to add voiceover, you have to click on Record Voice button (mic icon).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-videos-ezvid.jpg"                      alt="record video ezvid"                ></p><p>Step 5: If you want to trim the video in terms of duration, you can do it directly on its timeline. Not just that, you can crop video as well as add texts and images as required while editing.</p><p>Step 6: On the left side of the screen, you can add a title, a proper description, a perfect category as well as keywords to the video file.</p><p>Step 7: You can click on the Play button to get a preview before saving the file and uploading it on social media and video streaming platforms.</p><h2 id="3-Alternative-Tool-to-Record-Screen"><a href="#3-Alternative-Tool-to-Record-Screen" class="headerlink" title="3. Alternative Tool to Record Screen"></a>3. Alternative Tool to Record Screen</h2><p>While Ezvid screen recorder is good enough, Wondershare Filmora is simply better.

Naturally, the video quality is going to be stunning and it is crucial in gameplay recording. Ezvid has no option to record only a specific part of the screen that Filmora comes with. There are simply better filters, effects, and transitions available on Filmora.</p><p>Apart from giving voiceover, you can record your audio live with a microphone and use green screen technology using Filmora. Moreover, Filmora not just allows inserting of drawings but also captions and stickers. To sum it all up, Filmora is literally more professional for all perspectives, and therefore, Wondershare Filmora is the best alternative to Ezvid video maker.</p><p>Step 1: Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your PC.

Therefore, you should have the application running in the background if you want to record it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-record-screen.jpg"                      alt="freeseer screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 3: Go to Record menu option.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Record PC Screen option.</p><p>Step 5: From the pop-up box, you need to select the option to record the entire screen or only a specific screen part.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wondershare-screen-recorder-settings.jpg"                      alt="filmora recording settings"                ></p><p>Step 6: Finally, click on the Record button.</p><p>Step 7: Now, Filmora will give you a few seconds of buffer time so that you can go to the application or game whichever you want to record.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-recording-screen.jpg"                      alt="start screen recording"                ></p><p>Lastly, click on Stop button by hovering on to the top bar.

Key Features of Ezvid</h2><p>Ezvid video maker is a great screen recording software and here are the features that the software has to offer to satisfy all the requirements of the video creators.</p><p><strong>Record Screen and Facecam</strong></p><p>Ezvid is an incredible screen recorder to capture your desktop screen as well as browser screen. The user interface is clean and there is a direct option available to start recording the entire screen.

This makes the video more relatable and professional. Therefore, apart from recording the entire or part of the screen, you can record from the webcam and both the capturing is put together in the same video.</p><p><strong>Instant Screen Drawing</strong></p><p>Instead of waiting for the screen recording to get over and editing the recorded video to add drawings, you can add the required drawings live while recording the screen with Ezvid screen recorder.

This is a necessary feature professional video creators always look for in a screen recording and video editing software.</p><p><strong>Instant Slideshow Maker -</strong></p><p>Instead of making and editing videos all the time, you can also use Ezvid to make slideshows using screenshots and photos.

Luckily changing the destination where your screenshots are saved is a simple process that lets you decide where your images will be stored.</p><p>Here’s how you can change the location where the screenshots you take using the keyboard shortcuts will be saved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor-2"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor-2" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Save-Screenshots-to-a-Specific-Folder-on-Mac-2"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Save-Screenshots-to-a-Specific-Folder-on-Mac-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Save Screenshots to a Specific Folder on Mac"></a>Part 1: How to Save Screenshots to a Specific Folder on Mac</h2><p>Changing the folder where you store your screenshots is not an irreversible process, which means that you can reset the destination where the files are saved to Desktop at any point. Do not delete the new folder, because your Mac may not be able to take screenshots, afterward. The process described below is the only way you can delete a folder or add a new destination for your screenshots, and failing to comply with it may cause your Mac to malfunction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mac-screenshot-terminal.jpg"                      alt=" Mac Screenshots"                ></p><p>Create a new folder on the desired location on your hard drive, and then launch Terminal, by typing Terminal in the Search Box and clicking on its icon. Once the app is open, you should insert the following command into the Terminal window:</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screencapture location</strong></p><p>Then enter a space at the end after ‘location’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mac-screenshot-terminal-settings.jpg"                      alt=" Mac Screenshots"                ></p><p>The next step is to add the new location at which screenshots will be saved and you can do this by simply dragging the folder you created into Terminal and adding it at the end of the command you just entered. A path is created and the command line should now contain the folder’s unique location and it should look like this:</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screencapture location &#x2F;Users&#x2F;username&#x2F;Screenshots</strong></p><p>To execute the command you have to press Enter. After Terminal finishes running the command, its window will appear on the screen again. You should proceed to confirm the changes you’ve just made by resetting the User Interface on your computer. In order to do so, you’ll have to insert this command below the one you previously entered：</p><p><strong>killall SystemUIServer</strong></p><p>Hit Enter once more to confirm the changes and run the new command. Close Terminal app by clicking on the Terminal menu and selecting the Quick Terminal option. The default location where the screenshots are saved on your Mac is now changed and every time you take a screenshot using the Command + Shift + 3 shortcut the file will be saved at the new location. If for whatever reason you want to make the Desktop once again the destination where the screenshots on your computer will be saved here’s how you can do it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-the-Screenshot-Save-Location-Back-to-Desktop-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-the-Screenshot-Save-Location-Back-to-Desktop-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change the Screenshot Save Location Back to Desktop"></a>Part 2: How to Change the Screenshot Save Location Back to Desktop</h2><p>The process of changing the default screenshot save location back to Desktop is nearly identical to the process we just described.
