These might be due to unmanaged positioning of the hardware devices, improper configurations of the <strong>Zoom audio settings</strong>, or both. Some of the most common Zoom audio problems and their possible solutions are discussed below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-audio-advanced-settings.jpg"                      alt=" Zoom Meeting Settings Advanced Audio Settings "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144278/7443" target="_top" id="2144278">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144278" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144278/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-1-Audio-Feedback-Loop"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-1-Audio-Feedback-Loop" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 1: Audio Feedback Loop"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 1: Audio Feedback Loop</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It"><a href="#What-Is-It" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p>Audio feedback loop is when your voice keeps repeating itself for an indefinite number of times and never stops whatsoever.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >6 Top Voice Changer for Zoom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h5 id="How-It-Happens"><a href="#How-It-Happens" class="headerlink" title="How It Happens?"></a>How It Happens?</h5><p>When you are using external speakers and microphone, and both are placed nearby, any sound that comes out of the speaker is received by the microphone. If Zoom is configured to accept sounds from system audio, the mic sends the signals back to the speakers that again send the audio output to the mic. Since this iteration never ends, you continuously hear an audio feedback loop.</p><h5 id="How-to-Resolve-the-Audio-Loop-in-Zoom-Meeting"><a href="#How-to-Resolve-the-Audio-Loop-in-Zoom-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to Resolve the Audio Loop in Zoom Meeting?"></a>How to Resolve the Audio Loop in Zoom Meeting?</h5><p>In order to eliminate this issue, make sure to place both microphone and speakers at a safe distance from each other. This would prevent the microphone from receiving any output from the speakers, and the chain of audio feedback loop would never take place.</p><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-2-Background-Noise"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-2-Background-Noise" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 2: Background Noise"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 2: Background Noise</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It-1"><a href="#What-Is-It-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p>Background noise is the distortion or humming that you hear during an audio call on zoom.</p><h5 id="Why-I-hear-background-noise-in-Zoom-Meeting"><a href="#Why-I-hear-background-noise-in-Zoom-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Why I hear background noise in Zoom Meeting?"></a>Why I hear background noise in Zoom Meeting?</h5><p>If you have a highly sensitive microphone that is mostly used by professionals or in recording studios, the chances are that it will catch a lot of background noise during a Zoom meeting.</p><h5 id="How-to-remove-the-background-noise-in-Zoom-meeting"><a href="#How-to-remove-the-background-noise-in-Zoom-meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to remove the background noise in Zoom meeting?"></a>How to remove the background noise in Zoom meeting?</h5><p>This issue can be resolved by either hosting or joining a meeting in a closed, soundproof room, or using a less sensitive mic. It would be best if you use a normal headset that is easily available in any local electronic shop. You can also try enabling the <strong>Automatically adjust volume</strong> option from the <strong>Microphone</strong> section of the <strong>Audio</strong> category of the <strong>Settings</strong> box as explained earlier in <strong>Step 3</strong> of the <strong>Zoom Audio Settings When Not in Meeting</strong> section.</p><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-3-Echo"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-3-Echo" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 3: Echo"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 3: Echo</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It-2"><a href="#What-Is-It-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p><strong>Zoom audio echo</strong> is when you hear an echo sound during an ongoing Zoom meeting with audio enabled.</p><h5 id="How-It-Happens-1"><a href="#How-It-Happens-1" class="headerlink" title="How It Happens?"></a>How It Happens?</h5><p>Echo happens when you are on a laptop and are using onboard speakers and microphone, and that too with the speaker or mic volume set to maximum.</p><h5 id="How-to-remove-the-echo-in-the-Zoom-meeting"><a href="#How-to-remove-the-echo-in-the-Zoom-meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to remove the echo in the Zoom meeting?"></a>How to remove the echo in the Zoom meeting?</h5><p>As mentioned earlier, it is always advisable to use a headset to avoid any such unwanted echo or audio feedback loop issues. In case you don’t have access to a headset, try configuring the microphone settings to automatically adjust the volume, and not putting the speaker volume to the max.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Configuring <strong>Zoom audio settings</strong> before hosting or joining a meeting is always a wise approach to avoid any audio inconsistencies during an ongoing conference. However, if you are already in one, you can use the methods given above to configure the microphone settings to get the audio right. You are also encouraged to use an average quality headset during a Zoom meeting to avoid any <strong>Zoom audio echo</strong>, feedback loop, or background noises.</p><p>Related: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Improve Video Quality in Zoom Meetings? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><h5 id="Richard-Bennett-1"><a href="#Richard-Bennett-1" class="headerlink" title="Richard Bennett"></a>Richard Bennett</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>Are you confused about how to configure <strong>Zoom audio settings</strong> to get the best sound quality during a meeting?

You won’t be able to see these markers until the video clip is imported into the software’s video editor and placed on the timeline.</p><p>You can use them to mark a place in the screen recording you’re not too happy with, or to highlight the part of the video clip that you intend on featuring in the final cut of the video you’ve created with Wondershare’s screen capturing and screen recording software. By doing so you’ll save time on going through all the material just to find a few seconds of footage that fit perfectly to your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-markers.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Scrn Markers"                ></p><p>The <strong>timeline markers</strong>, on the other hand, can only be added to a project once you’ve completed the recording session, during the post-production period. You can utilize them to highlight the parts of the video clip you want to remove from the final version of your video or to mark the spots on the timeline where you’d like to switch from one take to another.</p><p>This type of marker is immensely useful if you want to organize the timeline in your project better and to know exactly where every clip you want to use in your video is located at all times. Besides being a highly efficient tool for organizing vast amounts of footage, timeline markers can also help you denote the beats in the audio file and then sync the video clip perfectly to the beat of the tune you’re using as a soundtrack to your video.</p><h2 id="How-to-Add-Markers-During-Video-Editing-and-After-Screen-Recording-in-Filmora-3"><a href="#How-to-Add-Markers-During-Video-Editing-and-After-Screen-Recording-in-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Add Markers During Video Editing and After Screen Recording in Filmora?"></a>How to Add Markers During Video Editing and After Screen Recording in Filmora?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><ul><li><a href="#filmora1">1.

Looking at the closed camera, you will find three discs lying on one another; they are a light ring, the camera unit and two hinges for adjusting the device on laptop or desktop monitor.

RecExperts is starting to look like a first-class application for all kinds of on-screen recording requirements, with the ability to output to 10+ commonly used recording formats (including MP4, MOV, and MP3), the ability to make GIFs directly from screen captures, and the ability to automatically stop and split recordings based on time or file size limits.</p><h2 id="2-How-to-Use-RecExperts"><a href="#2-How-to-Use-RecExperts" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Use RecExperts"></a>2. How to Use RecExperts</h2><p>EaseUS RecExperts is a premium screen recording software for Windows and Mac OS created by EaseUS.com. It’s a multi-purpose screen recorder that can do both screen recording and Webcam recording. RecExperts may also record full-screen or a specific part of the screen. The free trial version of RecExperts can be downloaded fast and conveniently from the EaseUS website, and the installation can be started right away.</p><p>Step 1: Launch EaseUS RecExperts</p><p>As can be seen in the screenshot below, the first function that is pre-selected for us when we launch the RecExperts program is the one that is necessary for capturing the complete default computer display. We have simple access to all of the software’s key functionalities as well as the main settings menu for modifying, among other things, the default file formats utilized, from this main program window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/easeus-recexperts.jpg"                      alt="easeus recexperts"                ></p><p>Step 2: Setup the Recording</p><p>For improved content distribution, you may record the single Webcam or use the Webcam as an overlay on a movie. With simplicity, you may pick full-screen recording, a specific portion of the screen, or a single window. Simply pressing the orange “REC” button will start the recording process; the main program windows will vanish at this point, being replaced by a smaller control window, as seen below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-setup-the-recording.jpg"                      alt="setup the recording"                ></p><p>Step 3: Finish&#x2F;Save Recording</p><p>We may finish the recording by clicking the red “stop” button after the screen recording is complete (which will, by default, include any sound outputted by the device during this process). When the recording is finished and the stop button is pushed, the RecExperts program will open the freshly recorded clip in the RecExperts editing suite, where we may continue to work with the material:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-recoring.jpg"                      alt="save recording"                ></p><h2 id="3-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#3-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="3.
