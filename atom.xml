    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Cost-Effective-OBS-Tuning-Steps"><a href="#Cost-Effective-OBS-Tuning-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Cost-Effective OBS Tuning Steps"></a>Cost-Effective OBS Tuning Steps</h2><p>In the past two decades, the digital and IT industry is growing at a jet pace. Programmers are inventing more applications to make our life easier. Similarly, the invention of youtube is one of its prevalent examples of all inventions. Billions of people are watching youtube, among them, millions are video streamers. Today Youtubers and other platform streamers are building costly computational machines to stream their videos with high resolutions and frames per second but it’s not the case for everyone like you and I cannot afford to build those high-end PC or Laptops.</p><p>Therefore, after vast research on the internet, our team came up with an optimal solution to show you a way to stream your videos lag-free, jitter-free, and without any blurriness in a costless way possible. We recommend you the best studio software known as OBS for your streaming using the best OBS settings for your low-end PC or a Laptop. These OBS settings will let you record videos for low-end PC or laptops to stream now without any issues. Keeping things in a little hurry let’s straight dive into the real stuff of this article.</p><h2 id="1-Video-Settings"><a href="#1-Video-Settings" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Settings"></a>1. Video Settings</h2><p>Since we are concerned about the streaming of video. It is important to know how to set up your videos settings. To set your video settings you need to follow the steps given below.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Go-to-Settings"><a href="#Step-1-Go-to-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Go to Settings"></a>Step 1: Go to Settings</h3><p>First, you will need to launch your OBS software. On the main menu, you have to go to file-&gt; settings. You will see a new window will pop up for settings as shown in the figure below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-video-settings-go-to-settings.jpg"                      alt="obs video settings go to settings"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Settings-That-You-Should-Keep"><a href="#Step-2-Settings-That-You-Should-Keep" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Settings That You Should Keep"></a>Step 2: Settings That You Should Keep</h3><p>Starting with base resolution, it is the video resolution that we are going to send to the people who are going to watch our stream. So for the best one, click on it and choose <strong>1280*720</strong>.</p><p>Output tab, which is the resolution of the video that the people will watch. For fast and lag-free streaming it’s best to keep both the output and base resolution the same to avoid any conversion between the resolution by CPU. So click on output resolution and choose <strong>1280*720</strong> again. If you noticed your computer is still lagging then it’s best to change to 480p but below this, it’s not recommended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-settings-that-you-should-keep.jpg"                      alt="obs settings that you should keep"                ></p><p>After that, it comes to the filter option. There are multiple filter options in this tab but for a fast and better result, you have to choose the <strong>“bilinear”</strong> filter as shown in the figure below. Finally, when it comes to frame per second you gotta be careful here. The more the fps the more it will put load on your CPU means it will become laggy but it is best to keep it <strong>30 fps</strong>, not more than this and not less than this if you are using a low-end PC or Laptop.</p><h3 id="Step-3-Output-Settings"><a href="#Step-3-Output-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Output Settings"></a>Step 3: Output Settings</h3><p>Once you are done with the general video settings now it’s time you should come to the output settings. For that, you will need to choose the output from the main vertical tab as shown in the figure below in 1. You will see a new window appears with a variety of settings. Now it’s time to choose the advanced setting as shown in 2 in the figure to see all settings to be edited.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-output-settings-edited.jpg"                      alt="obs output settings edited"                ></p><p>Let’s move towards the detail settings for the output video for your audience it’s best to choose the settings shown in the figure and below for lag-free and jitter-free video.</p><p><strong>Encoder:</strong></p><p>The first setting is the encoder setting for your output video. There are two options for it, if you are not using any NVidia graphics card and relying on CPU then it is best to choose x264, which will utilize your CPU.</p><p><strong>Rescale Output:</strong></p><p>The rescale output settings should be kept the same as 720p of the video you are streaming.</p><p><strong>Rate Control:</strong></p><p>Keep the rate control CBR.</p><p><strong>Bitrate:</strong></p><p>Normally, for low-end PCs, you should keep the bitrate to 3000 kbps. However, if you are finding it struggling with your PC in the form of a lag or jitteriness then it’s recommended to drop it low till you get the better results. For the NVIDIA card keep the bitrate to 3000 as it is perfectly fine for it.</p><p><strong>CPU Usage Preset:</strong></p><p>It comes with a lot of options to keep your CPU usage for the video. It is best recommended to keep the CPU usage very fast for good results. If you are using an NVIDIA graphics card then it is best to change the CPU usage to “performance” to get the best out of your machine.</p><p><strong>Profile:</strong></p><p>By default, the profile option is disabled and you should keep these settings as it is if you are not using the NVIDIA card but if it’s not so then it’s recommended to choose the “main” on the profiling option.</p><p>So that’s it for the video settings. These are all the settings that you need to adjust before streaming. After doing it so you just need to click apply button below and bingo it is done.</p><h2 id="2-Audio-Settings"><a href="#2-Audio-Settings" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio Settings"></a>2. Audio Settings</h2><p>For a clear and better audio performance, it’s also necessary you keep the optimum settings for the audio too. Well, you don’t have to worry now about the audio too. After reading this article you should keep the same audio settings here for your PC or Laptop.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Output-Audio"><a href="#Step-1-Output-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Output Audio"></a>Step 1: Output Audio</h3><p>The audio settings can be adjusted from two places. Let us discuss the first one. For that, you will need to select the output in the vertical tab and go to audio as shown in the figure below. You will see multiple tracks in these windows. It contains the audio settings for multiple sources. However, if you are using a single it’s good to choose 320 in track one. For multiple, there is no need to change the audio track but to keep the same 320. These are the perfect settings for most cases of the audio settings for your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-output-audio-settings-adjust.jpg"                      alt="obs output audio settings adjust"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Audio-Tab-Settings"><a href="#Step-2-Audio-Tab-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Audio Tab Settings "></a>Step 2: Audio Tab Settings <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-audio-tab-settings-steps.jpg"                      alt="obs audio tab settings steps"                ></h3><p>The audio consists of many settings,it is divided into categories lets start one by one and explain it.</p><p><strong>Sample Rate and Channels:</strong></p><p>It is the resolution of the audio. The more the sampling rate the more the bits of the audio you sent which means the more the quality of the audio improves. However, there is no need to keep it high but an optimum value works well too. Therefore, keep it <strong>48khz</strong> for the best result as shown. Another thing is a channel, which contains a lot of options but most of you will want the <strong>“stereo”</strong> since it’s the most common choice from the streamers.</p><p><strong>Desktop Audios:</strong></p><p>The desktop audio depends on the device you are using for the audio. It is best to use the default if you don’t know about your device otherwise choose USB if you are audio uses the USB port. For the second audio source, you can choose desktop audio 2 and set it accordingly.</p><p><strong>Auxiliary Audio:</strong></p><p>The streamers usually have one mic source but if you have multiple mic sources then you choose up to 4 auxiliary audio ports and set the device’s settings.</p><p><strong>Meter: Decay Rate &amp; Peak Meter Type:</strong></p><p>The meter is a decibel meter (dB). It is a measurement of volume. The more the decibels, the more it is loud. So use the decay rate to choose between fast, medium, and slow volumes accordingly to your needs. The Peak Meter type is used for your CPU usage. IF you have set higher CPU usage then go for the “true peak” otherwise chose “sample peak”.</p><p>Finally, the rest of the options should be kept as default since being a streamer you won’t need them to change and they are pretty much basic hotkeys to set up if you wish to.</p><h2 id="3-Stream-Settings"><a href="#3-Stream-Settings" class="headerlink" title="3. Stream Settings"></a>3. Stream Settings</h2><p>Here are the streaming settings that you just need to follow for your streaming videos. The streaming tab consists of settings for the platform you are going to stream your video.

After going to the main “stream” tab you will see a bunch of options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-stream-settings-tab-service-1.jpg"                      alt="obs stream settings tab service 1"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Streaming-Settings"><a href="#Step-2-Streaming-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Streaming Settings"></a>Step 2: Streaming Settings</h3><p><strong>Service:</strong></p><p>Here you have to choose the platform on which you are going to stream your videos.

Boasting a number of quirky features, such as multi-user functionality and a virus-free operating system based on Linux, Chromebooks even showcase the ability to allow users to capture screenshots in a number of different manners with ease. Within this article we’ve composed a 6-section guide on how to take a screenshot on a Chromebook, as well as how to edit them, at the touch of a button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                > Secure Download</p><h2 id="1-Taking-Screenshots-on-a-Chromebook-with-a-Keyboard"><a href="#1-Taking-Screenshots-on-a-Chromebook-with-a-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="1. Taking Screenshots on a Chromebook with a Keyboard"></a>1. Taking Screenshots on a Chromebook with a Keyboard</h2><p>Similar to the typical CTRL + PrtScn or PrtScn shortcut used on most Window’s PCs, or the Command + Control + Shift + 3 shortcut used on Mac devices, taking screenshots with the use of a keyboard on a Chromebook is equally as straight forward. To capture a screenshot of the entire screen, the process requires the use of the <strong>Windows Switcher Key</strong> (look for 3 layered rectangles that resemble open tabs&#x2F;windows) – this is generally located above the number 6 and 7 keys and close to the screen-brightness toggles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromebook-keyboard-screenshot.jpg"                      alt="Chromebook Screenshot"                ></p><p>The command “**Ctrl + *Windows Switcher Key*<strong>” will capture a screenshot of your current page, and the command “</strong>Ctrl + Shift + *Windows Switcher Key***” will allow users to capture a partial screenshot with the help from a handy drag-selector tool.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If your keyboard doesn’t seem to have the Screen Switcher key, <strong>try using F5 instead</strong>. To ensure your screenshot is copied into a specific document, select “<strong>Copy to Clipboard</strong>”. From here, you’ll be able to paste directly into a document.</p><h2 id="2-Taking-a-Screenshot-on-a-Chromebook-with-the-Use-of-Side-Buttons"><a href="#2-Taking-a-Screenshot-on-a-Chromebook-with-the-Use-of-Side-Buttons" class="headerlink" title="2. Taking a Screenshot on a Chromebook with the Use of Side Buttons"></a>2. Taking a Screenshot on a Chromebook with the Use of Side Buttons</h2><p>Using your Chromebook in tablet mode? If so, then there’s also a handy way to make use of the screenshot feature whilst on the go. Similar to the function offered on most Smart Phone Devices, simply press both the <strong>Power and Volume Down Side Button</strong> to capture a screenshot. Unfortunately, this feature is only useful if you’re looking to capture your entire screen; you’ll need to utilize the keyboard or stylus if you’re planning to crop out a specific section.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> No matter whether you’re utilizing the Chromebook in either landscape or portrait mode, the Volume Rockers still remain in the same orientation, so it’s worth noting which button relates to “Volume Down”.</p><h2 id="3-Taking-a-Screenshot-on-a-Chromebook-with-the-Use-of-a-Stylus"><a href="#3-Taking-a-Screenshot-on-a-Chromebook-with-the-Use-of-a-Stylus" class="headerlink" title="3.

Simply remove the stylus from the Chromebook and select the “<strong>Capture</strong> <strong>Screen</strong>” option from the <strong>Stylus Tool Menu</strong> (located on the lower task bar) to capture the whole screen. If you’re aiming to just capture a specific area, then simply select the “<strong>Capture Region</strong>” option. This option will allow users to highlight the particular area they’re looking to screenshot.</p><h2 id="4-Taking-a-Screenshot-on-a-Chromebook-with-the-Use-of-a-Third-Party-App-and-Extension"><a href="#4-Taking-a-Screenshot-on-a-Chromebook-with-the-Use-of-a-Third-Party-App-and-Extension" class="headerlink" title="4.

Press 4 and the recording will start. Please note that the other person will get an alert that the call is on recording mode.</p><p>Step 5: To stop Google Voice call recording, press 4 again. The recording will stop and it will be saved. The other person will get an alert that the call recording has stopped.</p><p>Step 6: You can access the recording from Voicemail tab. Otherwise, you can go to the last call from Google Voice call log and tap on Voicemail option. You can play the recording and listen to it instantly.</p><p>If you are using a Google Pixel smartphone, you can Google Voice Recorder app which is available exclusively for Pixel users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/step4.jpg"                      alt="step4"                ></p><p>All these steps are equally applicable on Android as well as iOS version of Google Voice.</p><h2 id="How-To-Record-Google-Voice-Call-On-Computer"><a href="#How-To-Record-Google-Voice-Call-On-Computer" class="headerlink" title="How To Record Google Voice Call On Computer?"></a>How To Record Google Voice Call On Computer?</h2><p>Google Voice is available for smartphones as well as computers through its web portal. You get all the features in its web version as the app version.

Add Dissolve Transitions to Video to Fade in and Fade out Video Footage"></a>1. Add Dissolve Transitions to Video to Fade in and Fade out Video Footage</h3><p>The first way to fade in and fade out the footage in Filmora is by applying dissolve transition. The dissolve, also called lap dissolve sometimes, is a gradual transition from one image to another. It is often used when the first image starts to disappear and the next image starts to display gradually.</p><p>So you can apply Dissolve transition at the beginning of the video from a black screen to fade in, and add dissolve transition at the end of the clip into the blackness to fade out.</p><p>Here is how to add dissolve transition in Filmora.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora9 Mac Version"                > </a></p><ul><li>After importing video footage into Filmora, drag and drop them in the timeline.</li><li>Go to the Transition tab and find Dissolve under the Basic category.

The rest of this process is identical on desktop and laptop PCs.</p><h4 id="Snapping-a-Snapshot-of-a-single-window"><a href="#Snapping-a-Snapshot-of-a-single-window" class="headerlink" title="Snapping a Snapshot of a single window"></a>Snapping a Snapshot of a single window</h4><p>Make sure that the window you want to capture is selected and then hold the Alt and PrtScn buttons at the same time. This action will copy the screenshot to the clipboard so you can proceed to paste in your favorite photo editor. Holding the Alt, Fn and PrtScn keys will enable you to take a snapshot of one window on most laptops.</p><h4 id="Choosing-the-Region-of-the-Screen-You-Want-to-Capture"><a href="#Choosing-the-Region-of-the-Screen-You-Want-to-Capture" class="headerlink" title="Choosing the Region of the Screen You Want to Capture"></a>Choosing the Region of the Screen You Want to Capture</h4><p>Choosing which area of the screen you will include in your screenshot is only possible on the Windows 10’s Creator Update. After pressing the Windows, Shift and S keys, your screen will become grayed, and you can just left-click and drag the mouse cursor to designate the region of the screen you’d like to capture. Once you are ready, let go of the left mouse button and the screenshot will be copied to the clipboard. Open a document or a software and paste the screenshot you’ve created using the Ctrl+V keys.</p><h4 id="Bonus-How-to-Take-Screenshots-on-a-Windows-Tablet"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Take-Screenshots-on-a-Windows-Tablet" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Take Screenshots on a Windows Tablet"></a>Bonus: How to Take Screenshots on a Windows Tablet</h4><p>All tablets offer a variety of ways to capture screenshots effortlessly. The quickest and easiest way to accomplish this is to use the hardware keys on your tablet, since other methods of taking screenshots on tablets may require you to invest more time and effort. Simply hold the Windows and Volume Down buttons and the device will take a screenshot that will be saved in the Screenshots folder, located in Pictures library. If you want to edit the screenshot you created on your tablet, you can use a photo editing app that enables you to crop the image or annotate the screenshot.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Taking screenshots on Windows 7,8 or 10 is a fun process that doesn’t require you to be a tech geek. Each method of creating screenshots we described in this article is equally effective, so anyone can choose the one they find the most convenient. Using Screen Sketch or Snipping Tool is the best option for PC owners who want to add annotations to their screenshots, while the PrtScrn button method is by far the quickest way to create a still image of a computer screen.</p><p>Leave a comment and let us know what is your favorite method of taking screenshots on PCs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-best-in-house-streaming-loggers/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Best In-House Streaming Loggers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-essentials-of-xbox-live-recording/"><u>2024 Approved  The Essentials of Xbox Live Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-ethical-considerations-for-saving-whatsapp-conversations/"><u>[New] Ethical Considerations for Saving WhatsApp Conversations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-integrated-technique-for-cross-platform-movie-logging/"><u>2024 Approved  Integrated Technique for Cross-Platform Movie Logging</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-conquer-the-shadows-5-ways-to-fix-black-screen-with-obs/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Conquer the Shadows  5 Ways to Fix Black Screen with OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-for-high-quality-presentation-capture/"><u>Comprehensive Guide for High-Quality Presentation Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-pure-pitch-perception-recording-in-mac-studios-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Pure Pitch Perception  Recording in Mac Studios for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/proven-ways-to-fix-there-was-a-problem-parsing-the-package-on-huawei-nova-y91-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Proven Ways to Fix There Was A Problem Parsing the Package on Huawei Nova Y91 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-ultimate-stop-motion-handbook-studio-alternatives-and-more/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved The Ultimate Stop Motion Handbook Studio, Alternatives, and More</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-revolutionary-gameplay-preservation-with-advanced-fbx-recording/"><u>[New] Revolutionary Gameplay Preservation with Advanced FBX Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-bypass-android-lock-screen-using-emergency-call-on-oppo-a59-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Bypass Android Lock Screen Using Emergency Call On Oppo A59 5G?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-facebook-video-shape-dimensions/"><u>2024 Approved  Facebook Video Shape Dimensions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-the-comprehensive-guide-to-using-luts-in-video-editing/"><u>[New] The Comprehensive Guide to Using LUTs in Video Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-achieve-superior-mp4-output-from-instagram-videos-2-ways/"><u>[New] In 2024, Achieve Superior MP4 Output From Instagram Videos 2 Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-how-to-transfer-music-from-apple-iphone-6s-plus-to-iphone-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>Ultimate Guide, How to Transfer Music From Apple iPhone 6s Plus to iPhone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-here-are-some-pro-tips-for-pokemon-go-pvp-battles-on-vivo-y100-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Here are Some Pro Tips for Pokemon Go PvP Battles On Vivo Y100 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

This is somewhat similar to what people did back in the Yahoo! Messenger era. However, unlike Yahoo! Messenger, Zoom doesn’t have open rooms where users could find new friends. Instead, it allows to chat only with those who are connected to each other through a conference call.</p><p>When talking about the chat configurations, all the contextual options can be accessed by clicking the <strong>Settings</strong> (<strong>Gear</strong>) icon from the top-right corner of the Zoom window, and selecting the <strong>Chat</strong> category from the left bar of the <strong>Settings</strong> window that opens up next.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-setting.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Settings icon"                ></p><p>Once there, following are the options that you can configure to secure your <strong>Zoom chat</strong> experience:</p><ul><li><strong>Active Status</strong></li></ul><p>Checked by default, the <strong>Change my status to “Away” when I am inactive for</strong> ‘n’ <strong>minutes</strong> lets you automatically change your active status to <strong>Away</strong> when Zoom doesn’t detect any input from you for a certain amount of time. The inactive time threshold can be configured by entering a value in the available box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-settings.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat Settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unblocking</strong></li></ul><p>The <strong>Manage blocked users</strong> button next to the <strong>Blocked users</strong> label lets you view the list all the users you have blocked. The <strong>Unblock</strong> button at the bottom of the <strong>Blocked users</strong> box allows you to unblock the users for chatting.</p><ul><li><strong>Push Notifications</strong></li></ul><p>The radio buttons under this section let you choose which type of chat messages can trigger push notifications so they are flashed on your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-notification-settings.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat Nofitications Settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Other Notifications</strong></li></ul><p>The <strong>Keywords</strong> button next to the <strong>Receive notifications for</strong> label lets you define the keywords in the chat messages that can trigger notifications.</p><ul><li><strong>DND</strong></li></ul><p>The <strong>Do not disturb from</strong> checkbox allows you to define the duration of the day when Zoom won’t notify you about any chat messages.</p><ul><li><strong>Message Previews</strong></li></ul><p>When the <strong>Show message preview</strong> box is unchecked, Zoom prevents the text of the chat messages from appearing on the screen, and you must open the message to view its content.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Chat-in-Zoom"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Chat-in-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Chat in Zoom"></a>Part 2: How to Chat in Zoom</h2><p>When it comes to texting there are several options available for you to choose <strong>how to chat in Zoom</strong>. For instance, you can send a message to everyone in the chat or send a private message to one of the participants, mention participant(s) while typing a message, and can even send a file to them if need be. You can learn how to do all these by following their corresponding methods given below:</p><h3 id="1-How-to-Mention-People-in-Zoom-Chat"><a href="#1-How-to-Mention-People-in-Zoom-Chat" class="headerlink" title="1. How to Mention People in Zoom Chat?"></a>1. How to Mention People in Zoom Chat?</h3><p>As it is with most social media platforms these days, even in Zoom chat, you can use the @ sign followed by the starting few characters of the person you want to mention. When you start typing, a list of participants with the matching names would appear, and you can then choose the one you want to mention.</p><h3 id="2-How-to-Send-Chat-Announcements"><a href="#2-How-to-Send-Chat-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Send Chat Announcements?"></a>2. How to Send Chat Announcements?</h3><p><strong>Note:</strong> Configuring and using the <strong>Announcements</strong> feature is <strong>only available for the paid members.</strong></p><p>The process of sending chat announcements with Zoom can be completed in three steps that are discussed below. While the first two steps explain how to enable the <strong>Announcements</strong> feature and add the users who can send or receive announcements, the third step teaches how to send announcements to all the users you added.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enable-Announcements"><a href="#Step-1-Enable-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enable Announcements"></a>Step 1: Enable Announcements</h4><p>Launch your favorite browser, sign in to the web portal of your Zoom account, go to <strong>Account Management</strong> &gt; <strong>IM Management</strong> &gt; <strong>IM Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Visibility</strong> and then turn on the <strong>Announcements</strong> switch.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Add-Users-for-Announcements"><a href="#Step-2-Add-Users-for-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Add Users for Announcements"></a>Step 2: Add Users for Announcements</h4><p>Click the <strong>+</strong> icon, in the available field type the email address(es) of the user(s) you want to allow to send or receive the announcements and click <strong>Add</strong> to add the participant(s) once found. Next, you can now safely sign out of the web portal of your Zoom account, and proceed to the next step.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Send-Announcements"><a href="#Step-3-Send-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Send Announcements "></a>Step 3: Send Announcements <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-announcement.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat  Announcements"                ></h4><p>Launch Zoom app and sign into your account. Click the <strong>Chat</strong> icon from the top, click <strong>Announcements</strong> from the left bar, type a message in the text box in the right and&#x2F;or attach a file if need be. Press <strong>Enter</strong> to send the message&#x2F;attachment as an announcement to all the recipients.</p><h3 id="3-What-File-Types-Does-Zoom-Chat-Support"><a href="#3-What-File-Types-Does-Zoom-Chat-Support" class="headerlink" title="3. What File Types Does Zoom Chat Support?"></a>3. What File Types Does Zoom Chat Support?</h3><p><strong>Note:</strong> Restricting file types and configuring other options granularly can only be done if you have purchased a paid subscription plan.</p><p>At the time of this writing, <strong>Zoom chat</strong> supports almost all types of files. However, by signing in to your account on Zoom’s web portal, you can restrict them by their extensions. For example, you can configure your Zoom account to send only the files with JPG, ZIP, or RAR extensions.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Save-Zoom-Chats"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Save-Zoom-Chats" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Save Zoom Chats"></a>Part 3: How to Save Zoom Chats</h2><p>Zoom also allows you to save your text conversions for future references.

To elaborate, you can either allow or disallow <strong>Zoom private chat</strong> for the members in a particular session, or can permanently disable the chat feature for your Zoom account altogether. To learn how to configure Zoom for both of these, you can follow the steps given below:</p><h3 id="1-How-to-Disable-Zoom-Private-Chat"><a href="#1-How-to-Disable-Zoom-Private-Chat" class="headerlink" title="1.

However, the encryption is disabled by default and must be enabled by turning on the <strong>Require Encryption for 3rd Party Endpoints (H323&#x2F;SIP)</strong> switch from the <strong>In Meeting (Basic)</strong> section.</p><p>Tips</p><p>As a video call host, if you don’t want the participant to save the chat content, you should enable <strong>Prevent participants from saving chat</strong> and save the changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-prevent-participants-from-saving-chat.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat  Saving Settings"                ></p><p>Furthermore, if you have a paid subscription of Zoom, you can use advanced encryption method that is available on the <strong>IM Management</strong> page on your account’s web portal. About the second question, the host cannot see the private messages that the participants send to each other during a meeting session.</p><h4 id="Q-Can-people-see-my-chat-when-I-am-screen-sharing"><a href="#Q-Can-people-see-my-chat-when-I-am-screen-sharing" class="headerlink" title="Q) Can people see my chat when I am screen sharing?"></a><strong>Q) Can people see my chat when I am screen sharing?</strong></h4><p>A) No.</p><p>As long as you are chatting using <strong>Zoom chat</strong>, other participants cannot see your conversation. However, if there is something else on your screen such as your Facebook profile&#x2F;chat, your email account, or your bank account’s page, all those windows can be viewed by the participants you are sharing your screen with.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>Zoom chat</strong> is an easy way to converse with the participants in case there are some typical words that need to be spelled or some files to be shared. These chats are not only encrypted, they can also be controlled by the host so that the participants can send messages only to the host, to each other, or to no one at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/hastyhit-freezevidsnapshot-for-2024/"><u>HastyHit FreezeVidSnapshot for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-obs-vs-streamlabs-which-is-better/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  OBS vs Streamlabs   Which Is Better?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-cutting-edge-recording-nintendo-switch-edition/"><u>[New] In 2024, Cutting-Edge Recording  Nintendo Switch Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-streamline-your-playback-the-ultimate-guide-to-roblox-replays-on-a-mac-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Streamline Your Playback  The Ultimate Guide to Roblox Replays on a Mac for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-guide-audio-free-video-recording-methods/"><u>2024 Approved  Guide  Audio-Free Video Recording Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-recording-the-next-level-of-play/"><u>[New] Recording the Next Level of Play</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/ultimate-list-best-mac-videos-grabber-software/"><u>Ultimate List  Best Mac Videos Grabber Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-prime-emulation-tools-sonys-ps1-classics-at-the-fingertips/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Prime Emulation Tools  Sony's PS1 Classics at the Fingertips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/embrace-the-art-of-timelapses-a-comprehensive-ipad-tutorial/"><u>Embrace the Art of Timelapses  A Comprehensive iPad Tutorial</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-highest-rated-video-call-software-not-zoom-for-pcs-and-phones/"><u>In 2024, Highest-Rated Video Call Software (Not Zoom) for PCs & Phones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-enjoy-youtube-on-iphoneipad-with-the-leading-ios-fb-video-downloader/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Enjoy YouTube on iPhone/iPad with the Leading iOS FB Video Downloader</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-the-canvas-of-success-unveiling-10-essential-design-tricks/"><u>[Updated] The Canvas of Success  Unveiling 10 Essential Design Tricks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/new-top-10-essential-harvesting-tools-for-video-editors/"><u>New Top 10 Essential Harvesting Tools for Video Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-proficiently-follow-facebook-live-updates/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, How to Proficiently Follow Facebook Live Updates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-tutorial-on-permanently-removing-your-instagram-profile-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Tutorial on Permanently Removing Your Instagram Profile for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/start-small-livestreaming-on-youtube-with-fewer-than-1k-followers-for-2024/"><u>Start Small  Livestreaming on YouTube with Fewer Than 1K Followers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-elevate-your-audio-experience-the-top-5-android-editors-for-high-fidelity-sounds/"><u>Updated In 2024, Elevate Your Audio Experience The Top 5 Android Editors for High-Fidelity Sounds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-live-streaming.techidaily.com/updated-a-guide-to-using-obs-studio-to-stream-to-facebook-for-2024/"><u>Updated A Guide to Using OBS Studio To Stream to Facebook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/ace-titles-essentials-for-digital-marketing-success/"><u>Ace Titles  Essentials for Digital Marketing Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-realme-note-50-phone-password-without-factory-reset-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock Realme Note 50 Phone Password Without Factory Reset?</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>
