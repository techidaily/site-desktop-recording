While using a smartphone, ensure that it has enough battery to last at least for a couple of hours, and doesn’t exhaust during the meeting. For laptops, it is advisable to use an average quality headset with a microphone instead of onboard speakers and mic.</p><h4 id="Tip-2-Meeting-Transcription-Software-Security"><a href="#Tip-2-Meeting-Transcription-Software-Security" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Meeting Transcription Software Security"></a>Tip 2: Meeting Transcription Software Security</h4><p>While subscribing for any third-party transcription service, make sure to check their privacy policies and confirm if they are agreeable. Since you will be uploading quite sensitive information that may contain your trade secrets, only the service provider with good privacy policy and robust encryption algorithms should be allowed to handle your files.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>Zoom transcriptions</strong>  come in handy when you plan to discuss some crucial matters in a meeting, and want all the details to be documented with proper timestamps. In case it is a video conference that is to be recorded, you can choose a service provider that offers close and open captioning as well.</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Improve Video Quality in Zoom Meetings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> &gt;&gt;</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-peerless-picture-grabber-for-your-win11-screen/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Peerless Picture Grabber - For Your Win11 Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-beyond-ustream-live-streaming-choices-for-2024/"><u>[New] Beyond Ustream  Live Streaming Choices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-pixelperfect-screen-capture-software/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  PixelPerfect Screen Capture Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-immortalizing-the-epic-sagas-of-pc-gaming-6-pro-tips/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Immortalizing the Epic Sagas of PC Gaming  6 Pro Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-infographic-top-insights-into-fifa-football-videos-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] Infographic - Top Insights Into FIFA Football Videos On YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-rx-memory-treasure/"><u>[Updated] RX Memory Treasure</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/2024-approved-refinement-of-music-files-on-mac-a-look-at-the-most-acclaimed-mp3-editors/"><u>2024 Approved Refinement of Music Files on Mac A Look at the Most Acclaimed MP3 Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/diving-deep-into-stellars-mac-interface/"><u>Diving Deep Into Stellar's Mac Interface</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/does-samsung-galaxy-f54-5g-has-native-hevc-support-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-hevc-video-on-android/"><u>Does Samsung Galaxy F54 5G has native HEVC support?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-use-life360-on-windows-pc-for-xiaomi-redmi-a2-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Use Life360 on Windows PC For Xiaomi Redmi A2?

A layer can be described as any type of image, moving or still, that is superimposed over a background image. However, just adding one layer over another will not create a strong visual impact on the spectator, which is why using Blending Modes is recommended if you want to <strong>blend two overlaying videos or images</strong> seamlessly.</p><p>It is a widely accepted opinion that Blend Modes can only be used in Adobe Premiere Pro or After Effects, but in this article, we are going to bust that myth and show you how to utilize Blending Modes in Filmora Scrn. Before we get started, let’s figure out what blending modes is.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40002162&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/1_Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF Perpetual (1 PC) Free upgrade. No monthly fees ever.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aofit.pxf.io/c/5597632/1399701/16396" target="_top" id="1399701"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16396-1399701"                      border="0" alt="" width="960" height="300"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1399701/16396"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-are-Blending-Modes-in-Filmora"><a href="#What-are-Blending-Modes-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="What are Blending Modes in Filmora?"></a>What are Blending Modes in Filmora?</h2><p>Combining videos or images into a single frame is an art that is much older than digital pictures, so when trying to understand Blend Modes in Filmora Scrn it is best to try to visualize two pieces of celluloid film, one over another. Two pieces of film are transparent, but the images they contain do not mix with each other, that is why when you are using Blend Modes in Filmora Scrn you are actually merging videos and allowing their pixels to mix.</p><p>Different ways of combining pixels are called modes, and for that reason, the properties of the <strong>Linear Burn mode</strong> are not the same as the properties of the <strong>Multiply blending mode</strong>. Each mode you select, brings preset image transparency as well as brightness, contrast and color values. Which mode you will use depends mostly on the context and the images you want to use in your video.</p><p>The <strong>Normal mode</strong> is a part of the standard set of blending modes in almost all photo and video editing programs. It enables you to keep the top layer intact, by preventing the pixels from two images to merge. It is a perfect PIP blending mode since it allows you to keep two overlaying images separate and have two different narratives within the same shot. Producers of YouTube videos and tutorials of any kind or gamers who want to entertain their audiences should use the Normal mode when editing their footage captured with Filmora Scrn.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-normal-mode.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><p>The <strong>Screen Mode</strong> is best used when you are working with dark monochrome backgrounds because it reduces the dark areas in the video thus enabling you to blend the top layer into the background seamlessly.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2086436/19576" target="_top" id="2086436"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2086436"                      border="0" alt="" width="1500" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2086436/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-screen-mode.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><p>Utilizing this mode successfully requires previous preparation because the effects you’ll get if you use the Screen mode with a footage that is not best suited for this mode are far from impressive. Therefore, the video clips you want to overlay and blend with each other must be recorded perfectly in order to get the best results.</p><p>The <strong>Multiply Mode</strong> is also one of the frequently used blending modes that <strong>multiplies the numbers for each pixel of the overlaying video clip</strong> with a matching pixel from the background video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-multiply-mode.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora Scrn Blending modes"                ></p><p>This mode will enable you to create the black background for your video effortlessly, and highlight the subjects in the video clip you intend to use as a top layer. You need to choose carefully which video clips you are going to use and how are they going to look on a dark background if you want to produce visually pleasing videos that captivate the viewer’s attention.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2095385/26400" target="_top" id="2095385"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2095385"                      border="0" alt="" width="1024" height="1024"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2095385/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-use-Blending-Modes"><a href="#How-to-use-Blending-Modes" class="headerlink" title="How to use Blending Modes?"></a>How to use Blending Modes?</h2><p>Applying different blending modes and switching between them is easy, and it won’t take more than a few minutes of your time, once you get a hold of it.

Each external monitor will display identical images when turned on, but in order to move software windows between the two screens, you’ll have to enable the ‘Extend These Displays’ option. The actual steps you’ll need to take may vary, depending on the computer and the OS you are using, and we are going to show you how to extend displays on Windows 8 or later.</p><p>Head over to the Start Menu, and open the Control Panel. Select the ‘Adjust Screen Resolution’ option in the Appearance and Personalization menu, and then click on the Multiple Displays drop-down menu. Pick the ‘Extend These Displays’ option from the list and proceed to save the changes by clicking on the OK button.</p><h3 id="Recording-Multiple-Monitors-With-OBS-Studio"><a href="#Recording-Multiple-Monitors-With-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Recording Multiple Monitors With OBS Studio"></a>Recording Multiple Monitors With <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >OBS Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Widely accepted as one of the best open-source broadcasting and screen recording software ever created, OBS Studio also enables its users to record multiple screens simultaneously. The plug-in for the OBS called Simple Scene Switcher that detects on which monitor the mouse cursor is and that automatically switches between two monitors as you drag a mouse is a great option if you don’t want to record multiple displays at the same time. The plug-in lets you switch between windows without disrupting the flow of the video, which makes it particularly useful for LoL players and in numerous other situations. Here’s how you can record multiple monitors with OBS.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Adding-a-Second-Display"><a href="#Step-1-Adding-a-Second-Display" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 - Adding a Second Display"></a>Step 1 - Adding a Second Display</h4><p>Once you launch the software, you should use the right-click to access the software’s drop-down menu. Locate the Add feature and select the Display Capture option. Create&#x2F;Select Source window will pop-up, hit OK and once the Properties window appears on screen you should select your second monitor form the Display drop-down list.

But the best screen recorder for Roblox is Wondershare Filmora where you can also edit your recorded gameplay like a pro.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-streamlining-video-conferencing-with-efficient-use-of-snap-features-on-google-meet/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Streamlining Video Conferencing with Efficient Use of Snap Features on Google Meet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-changing-image-filenames-for-macscreenshots/"><u>[New] In 2024, Changing Image Filenames for MacScreenshots</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-pixel-queens-rising-youtubes-top-10/"><u>[New] Pixel Queens Rising  YouTube's #Top 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-tutorial-on-designing-dynamic-facebook-slides/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Tutorial on Designing Dynamic Facebook Slides</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-podcast-openings-unveiled-scripted-appeals-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Podcast Openings Unveiled  Scripted Appeals for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unbound-zen-audio-releases/"><u>2024 Approved  Unbound Zen Audio Releases</u></a></li><li><a href="https://animation-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-create-picsart-cartoon/"><u>2024 Approved How to Create Picsart Cartoon</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/3-ways-to-track-oppo-reno-10-proplus-5g-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways to Track Oppo Reno 10 Pro+ 5G without Them Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/9-solutions-to-fix-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-5g-system-crash-issue-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>9 Solutions to Fix Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 5G System Crash Issue | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/diving-deep-into-stellars-mac-interface/"><u>Diving Deep Into Stellar's Mac Interface</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/enhance-content-categorization-top-picks-for-the-7-cheapest-youtube-taggification-apps-for-2024/"><u>Enhance Content Categorization  Top Picks for the 7 Cheapest Youtube Taggification Apps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/hearing-beginnings-mastering-volume-control-in-adobe-audition-for-2024/"><u>Hearing Beginnings  Mastering Volume Control in Adobe Audition for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-oneplus-12r-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How PGSharp Save You from Ban While Spoofing Pokemon Go On OnePlus 12R? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-update-apple-iphone-14-without-data-loss-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How to Update Apple iPhone 14 without Data Loss? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-expert-advice-for-mastering-full-screen-in-ppro/"><u>In 2024, Expert Advice for Mastering Full Screen in PPro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-in-depth-ice-cream-viewer-technology-study/"><u>In 2024, In-Depth Ice Cream Viewer Technology Study</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-infinite-possibilities-on-a-track-top-5-racing-simulators-reviewed/"><u>In 2024, Infinite Possibilities on a Track  Top 5 Racing Simulators Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-innovative-11-audio-devices-for-professionals/"><u>In 2024, Innovative 11 Audio Devices for Professionals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-insider-secrets-to-record-sims-gaming/"><u>In 2024, Insider Secrets to Record Sims Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-iphone-sound-capturing-101-voice-memo-processing/"><u>In 2024, IPhone Sound Capturing 101 – Voice Memo Processing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-is-higher-frame-rate-better-weighing-30-vs-60fps-in-video/"><u>In 2024, Is Higher Frame Rate Better?

A number of great development studios were closing, and even mainstream series like Need for Speed struggled to maintain their original popularity.</p><p>If you are a racing fan, then there is good news for you. Things are a lot better today as compared to the past. Several racing titles have been introduced over the years, like Forza Horizon, Assetto Corsa, iRacing, etc. We have seen several open-world racing games getting immense popularity among gamers. The simulation racing genre is more competitive than ever today. In July 2015, EA acquired Codemasters for a staggering $1.2 billion, illustrating how highly racing games have been valued for the last few years.</p><p>This article will present our top picks of the best sim racing games you can play right now. Most of these games are modern because this genre is continuously improving. But, we won’t be skipping those classic titles that are still popular among gamers and as good as modern ones. Our primary focus here will be to cover those games that are easy to find and play on the majority of the hardware. So without wasting any time, let’s get to our main topic.</p><h2 id="THE-BEST-SIM-RACING-GAMES"><a href="#THE-BEST-SIM-RACING-GAMES" class="headerlink" title="THE BEST SIM RACING GAMES"></a>THE BEST SIM RACING GAMES</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/c/5597632/1864921/20702" target="_top" id="1864921"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1864921"                      border="0" alt="" width="1251" height="1042"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Dirt-Rally-2-0"><a href="#1-Dirt-Rally-2-0" class="headerlink" title="1.Dirt Rally 2.0"></a>1.Dirt Rally 2.0</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1596691/17882" target="_top" id="1596691"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1596691"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1596691/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dirt-rally-poster.jpg"                      alt="dirt-rally-poster"                ></p><p>If you are looking for the best off-road racing simulation gamers, then dirt rally 2.0 stands on the top of the list. There has probably never been anything better. Despite its unbalanced package, this car offers outstanding handling and a driving experience as gripping as anything else in this class. The best way to experience it is with a good wheel, but it’s unbeatable for communicating the pure thrill of a car and the challenge of a course.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>In terms of career mode, both rallycross and rally mode is available.</li><li>You can play Freeplay to compete for titles, create your own custom game, and run-time trials across all tracks.</li><li>In addition to joining the team, players can increase the ability of team members.</li><li>Overall it offers a great gameplay experience which is worth all the effort.</li></ul><h3 id="2-iRacing"><a href="#2-iRacing" class="headerlink" title="2.iRacing"></a>2.iRacing</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iracing-poster.jpg"                      alt="iracing-poster"                ></p><p>The eSports industry is well known for three things: its costs, time commitment, and toughness. In addition to that, it encapsulates some of the most exciting aspects of motorsport. As you work your way through the ranks, you will experience the same camaraderie and excitement as the real deal - and, yes, crushing disappointment too. It’s undeniable that some aspects of Iracing are becoming a bit stale - and there are certainly more realistic-looking sims out there - but with ten years of experience comes a level of competency you won’t find anywhere else.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The technology and features it offers are superior to those of its competitors.</li><li>The tracks are very authentic, realistic, and accurate.</li><li>A huge selection of cars is available. Players can find their dream cars in this game.</li><li>The sim racing experience that it offers is unmatchable to any other game.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Assetto-Corsa-Assetto-Corsa-Competizione"><a href="#3-Assetto-Corsa-Assetto-Corsa-Competizione" class="headerlink" title="3.Assetto Corsa &#x2F; Assetto Corsa Competizione"></a>3.Assetto Corsa &#x2F; Assetto Corsa Competizione</h3><p><strong>Platforms</strong>: PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/assetto-corse-competizione-poster.jpg"                      alt="assetto-corse-competizione-poster"                ></p><p>The two experiences offered by Kunos Simulazioni are so different, yet both so good, that we’ve included them both. Assetto Corsa has seen better days, but it can still be an awesome driving sim with a few mods, and Competizione is getting better as it reaches iRacing as a pure racing sim. As far as GT racing is concerned, it is probably the healthiest and most diverse form of motorsports right now.</p><p>Assetto Corsa also has a number of useful force feedback options that will let you experience driving a car without having to feel it. You are likely to have the most difficulty getting used to a PC when you start. In reality, you’ll need to step it up when it’s time to get real.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The career mode provides a very real experience where you progress as a racer and earn titles and rewards.</li><li>The advanced physics engine makes it the next-generation simulation game.</li><li>Although the car selection is not so wide, if you don’t mind playing with mods, you won’t get bored with this game.</li><li>The best thing about this game is that you can play it using any kind of device like a keyboard, controller, joystick, etc.</li><li>It provides the best hardware compatibility.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Project-Cars-2"><a href="#4-Project-Cars-2" class="headerlink" title="4.Project Cars 2"></a>4.Project Cars 2</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/project-cars-2-poster.png"                      alt="project-cars-2-poster"                ></p><p>Project Cars 2 is likewise available on modern consoles, so you can also expect polish and presentation, including an offline career mode that is light but solid. Cars and tracks are abundant here, especially if you purchase the season pass along with numerous car packs.</p><p>Physicists have made these improvements to accommodate the physics engine, like in Assetto Corsa. Driving a car is fun because they are responsive and fun, but I always have difficulties connecting with them. The wide range of vehicles here, from two-stroke karts to four-wheel-drive rally vehicles, makes it all feel the same, which is a problem.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The physics is much better than the competition.</li><li>Classic and new cars are available.</li><li>Race tracks of even better quality.</li><li>Track and weather conditions that are dynamic.</li><li>The difficulty level can be adjusted very easily.</li><li>The PC version of this game has amazing VR.</li></ul><h3 id="5-rFactor-2"><a href="#5-rFactor-2" class="headerlink" title="5.rFactor 2"></a>5.rFactor 2</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rfactor2-poster.png"                      alt="rfactor2-poster"                ></p><p>We go way, way back with rFactor. Its core physics engine was used to power older iconic games, like F1 Challenge 2002. Ad-hoc online leagues and modified mods were my only choice back then. The list of licensed cars and tracks in rFactor 2 is now extensive (and is still growing), and it even includes some of the most competitive online racing series around.</p><p>RFactor 2 is the one game that gets seriously out of everything I’ve listed so far. The game doesn’t come with a half-dozen offline career modes or a complex licensing system that unlocks cars. There’s a menu where you choose where to race, which car to drive, and then you’re off. Offline racing is certainly possible, and the artificially intelligent competition will provide a good challenge, but the most frightful competition is usually to be found online – including the likes of Max Verstappen.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The physics of this game is the most complex among all sim racing games.</li><li>The handling of cars is way better.</li><li>Different weather and day and night conditions of the game make it much more appealing.</li><li>You can choose from some really high-quality mods with great mod support.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://proteahair.pxf.io/c/5597632/1983634/23621" target="_top" id="1983634"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1983634"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983634/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Sim racing is one of the most favorite sub-genre of racing lovers. So, we have presented you with a list of some of the best sim racing games that are available in the market right now. All these games work on almost the same physics. The only difference is between graphics, cars, maps, tracks, mods, and other technicalities. All games have their own pros and cons. Some offer the fastest cars while others offer better handling. It all comes down to user choice and preferences.

In addition to that, it encapsulates some of the most exciting aspects of motorsport. As you work your way through the ranks, you will experience the same camaraderie and excitement as the real deal - and, yes, crushing disappointment too. It’s undeniable that some aspects of Iracing are becoming a bit stale - and there are certainly more realistic-looking sims out there - but with ten years of experience comes a level of competency you won’t find anywhere else.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The technology and features it offers are superior to those of its competitors.</li><li>The tracks are very authentic, realistic, and accurate.</li><li>A huge selection of cars is available.

Assetto Corsa has seen better days, but it can still be an awesome driving sim with a few mods, and Competizione is getting better as it reaches iRacing as a pure racing sim. As far as GT racing is concerned, it is probably the healthiest and most diverse form of motorsports right now.</p><p>Assetto Corsa also has a number of useful force feedback options that will let you experience driving a car without having to feel it. You are likely to have the most difficulty getting used to a PC when you start.

Driving a car is fun because they are responsive and fun, but I always have difficulties connecting with them.

Its core physics engine was used to power older iconic games, like F1 Challenge 2002. Ad-hoc online leagues and modified mods were my only choice back then. The list of licensed cars and tracks in rFactor 2 is now extensive (and is still growing), and it even includes some of the most competitive online racing series around.</p><p>RFactor 2 is the one game that gets seriously out of everything I’ve listed so far. The game doesn’t come with a half-dozen offline career modes or a complex licensing system that unlocks cars. There’s a menu where you choose where to race, which car to drive, and then you’re off. Offline racing is certainly possible, and the artificially intelligent competition will provide a good challenge, but the most frightful competition is usually to be found online – including the likes of Max Verstappen.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The physics of this game is the most complex among all sim racing games.</li><li>The handling of cars is way better.</li><li>Different weather and day and night conditions of the game make it much more appealing.</li><li>You can choose from some really high-quality mods with great mod support.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Sim racing is one of the most favorite sub-genre of racing lovers. So, we have presented you with a list of some of the best sim racing games that are available in the market right now. All these games work on almost the same physics. The only difference is between graphics, cars, maps, tracks, mods, and other technicalities. All games have their own pros and cons. Some offer the fastest cars while others offer better handling. It all comes down to user choice and preferences. If you are new to the sim racing environment, you can try all these titles and then decide which one suits you the best.</p><p><a href="#">Try It Free</a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a href="#">Try It Free</a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-art-of-curating-digital-stories-on-fb/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  The Art of Curating Digital Stories on FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/new-crafting-captivating-podcasts-a-step-by-step-writing-guide/"><u>[New] Crafting Captivating Podcasts  A Step-by-Step Writing Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-from-imagination-to-reality-mastering-12-top-tier-collage-skills/"><u>[New] From Imagination to Reality  Mastering 12 Top-Tier Collage Skills</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-growth-by-numbers-tapping-into-youtube-analytics-power/"><u>[New] Growth by Numbers  Tapping Into YouTube Analytics Power</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-innovative-screen-capture-on-mac-top-5-methods/"><u>[New] In 2024, Innovative Screen Capture on Mac, Top 5 Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-ideal-approaches-to-mobile-content-preservation/"><u>[Updated] Ideal Approaches to Mobile Content Preservation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-discord-profile-video-info-dimensions-codec-time-span/"><u>2024 Approved  Discord Profile Video Info  Dimensions, Codec, Time Span</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-find-your-way-the-insider-guide-to-youtube-video-management-hub/"><u>2024 Approved  Find Your Way  The Insider Guide to YouTube Video Management Hub</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-resolutionrefiner-x1-high-res-video-enhancer/"><u>2024 Approved  ResolutionRefiner X1 -

This is somewhat similar to what people did back in the Yahoo! Messenger era. However, unlike Yahoo! Messenger, Zoom doesn’t have open rooms where users could find new friends. Instead, it allows to chat only with those who are connected to each other through a conference call.</p><p>When talking about the chat configurations, all the contextual options can be accessed by clicking the <strong>Settings</strong> (<strong>Gear</strong>) icon from the top-right corner of the Zoom window, and selecting the <strong>Chat</strong> category from the left bar of the <strong>Settings</strong> window that opens up next.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-setting.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Settings icon"                ></p><p>Once there, following are the options that you can configure to secure your <strong>Zoom chat</strong> experience:</p><ul><li><strong>Active Status</strong></li></ul><p>Checked by default, the <strong>Change my status to “Away” when I am inactive for</strong> ‘n’ <strong>minutes</strong> lets you automatically change your active status to <strong>Away</strong> when Zoom doesn’t detect any input from you for a certain amount of time. The inactive time threshold can be configured by entering a value in the available box.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097466/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097466"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097466"                      border="0" alt="" width="2048" height="1024"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097466/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-settings.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat Settings"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Unblocking</strong></li></ul><p>The <strong>Manage blocked users</strong> button next to the <strong>Blocked users</strong> label lets you view the list all the users you have blocked.

For example, you can configure your Zoom account to send only the files with JPG, ZIP, or RAR extensions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="1080" height="1620" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:1080px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3: How to Save Zoom Chats<p>Zoom also allows you to save your text conversions for future references.

Can Zoom host see private chats?"></a><strong>Q) Is Zoom chat secure, safe, and encrypted? Can Zoom host see private chats?</strong></h4><p><strong>A) Yes and No.</strong></p><p>To answer the first question, Zoom chats are encrypted. However, the encryption is disabled by default and must be enabled by turning on the <strong>Require Encryption for 3rd Party Endpoints (H323&#x2F;SIP)</strong> switch from the <strong>In Meeting (Basic)</strong> section.</p><p>Tips</p><p>As a video call host, if you don’t want the participant to save the chat content, you should enable <strong>Prevent participants from saving chat</strong> and save the changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-chat-prevent-participants-from-saving-chat.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Meeting Chat  Saving Settings"                ></p><p>Furthermore, if you have a paid subscription of Zoom, you can use advanced encryption method that is available on the <strong>IM Management</strong> page on your account’s web portal. About the second question, the host cannot see the private messages that the participants send to each other during a meeting session.</p><h4 id="Q-Can-people-see-my-chat-when-I-am-screen-sharing"><a href="#Q-Can-people-see-my-chat-when-I-am-screen-sharing" class="headerlink" title="Q) Can people see my chat when I am screen sharing?"></a><strong>Q) Can people see my chat when I am screen sharing?</strong></h4><p>A) No.</p><p>As long as you are chatting using <strong>Zoom chat</strong>, other participants cannot see your conversation. However, if there is something else on your screen such as your Facebook profile&#x2F;chat, your email account, or your bank account’s page, all those windows can be viewed by the participants you are sharing your screen with.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>Zoom chat</strong> is an easy way to converse with the participants in case there are some typical words that need to be spelled or some files to be shared. These chats are not only encrypted, they can also be controlled by the host so that the participants can send messages only to the host, to each other, or to no one at all.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-a-curators-cut-best-of-the-best-reading-list-from-tiktok/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  A Curator's Cut  Best of the Best Reading List From TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-craft-intense-conversations-on-discord-learn-effective-message-pinning-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Craft Intense Conversations on Discord  Learn Effective Message Pinning for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-how-to-protectively-download-youtube-audio-without-fear-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Protectively Download YouTube Audio Without Fear for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-the-complete-blueprint-for-exceptional-asmr-production-value/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Complete Blueprint for Exceptional ASMR Production Value</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-perfectly-smooth-window-snap-tool-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Perfectly Smooth Window Snap Tool for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-guide-to-effective-twitter-de-following/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Guide to Effective Twitter De-Following</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/8-solutions-to-fix-find-my-friends-location-not-available-on-realme-c55-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>8 Solutions to Fix Find My Friends Location Not Available On Realme C55 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/assessing-sns-hdr-pro-habits-and-alternative-options-for-2024/"><u>Assessing SNS HDR Pro’ Habits & Alternative Options for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/beginners-guide-how-to-use-voice-changer-plus-on-your-iphone-for-2024/"><u>Beginners Guide How to Use Voice Changer Plus on Your iPhone for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/diving-deep-into-stellars-mac-interface/"><u>Diving Deep Into Stellar's Mac Interface</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/essential-guide-to-economical-multiplatform-video-conferencing-software-for-2024/"><u>Essential Guide to Economical, Multiplatform Video Conferencing Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/eyevid-fb-content-grabber/"><u>EyeVid  FB Content Grabber</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/ice-racing-royalty-olympians-highlights-2022-for-2024/"><u>Ice Racing Royalty  Olympians' Highlights, 2022 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-disabling-apple-iphone-14-pro-max-parental-restrictions-withwithout-password-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Disabling Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max Parental Restrictions With/Without Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-in-depth-analysis-of-vlc-recorder-app/"><u>In 2024, In-Depth Analysis of VLC Recorder App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-in-depth-ice-cream-viewer-technology-study/"><u>In 2024, In-Depth Ice Cream Viewer Technology Study</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-innovative-11-audio-devices-for-professionals/"><u>In 2024, Innovative 11 Audio Devices for Professionals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-insider-secrets-to-record-sims-gaming/"><u>In 2024, Insider Secrets to Record Sims Gaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-iphone-sound-capturing-101-voice-memo-processing/"><u>In 2024, IPhone Sound Capturing 101 – Voice Memo Processing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-is-higher-frame-rate-better-weighing-30-vs-60fps-in-video/"><u>In 2024, Is Higher Frame Rate Better?

You’ll need to have a PlayStation 2 BIOS in order to run certain emulators like DamonPS2 Pro, for example. On Google, you may also download this file and put it into the app’s folder.

The frame rate, or “FPS” or frames per second, is a typical indication of a game’s playability. Around 30 is the typical best ps2 emulator android gaming pace. A 0 to 20 fps Android phone game is almost unplayable, 21 to 29 fps is acceptable, and 30 fps and beyond is nearly as enjoyable as playing on a console.</p><p><strong>Do PS2 emulation software and PSX software operate together?</strong></p><p>Ps2 emulator for android, on the other hand, only play PS2 games.
