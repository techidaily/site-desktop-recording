Google Meet integrates Jamboard, an online tool that enables you to brainstorm ideas during the virtual meet-up. The meeting host can easily activate Jamboard after starting a meeting. This makes <strong>Google Meet Whiteboarding</strong> easily accessible for all participants during the live session. In this way, students can collaborate with instructors or other students very clearly. Moreover, the whiteboard feature also allows them to answer questions and review notes. Let’s know how to use a whiteboard in Google Meet and how it works.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-a-Whiteboard-in-Google-Meet-on-a-Laptop-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-a-Whiteboard-in-Google-Meet-on-a-Laptop-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use a Whiteboard in Google Meet on a Laptop?"></a><strong>Part 2: How to Use a Whiteboard in Google Meet on a Laptop?</strong></h2><p>The in-built whiteboard can be comfortably used in Google Meet on a laptop. You do not need any extension or third-party application to use a whiteboard. Moreover, you can create a new whiteboard or use the one you have already created. You can access the already saved whiteboard from Google Drive. If you want to excel in the art of creating a whiteboard on Google Meet, we have summarized the process in simple steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Join Google Meeting</strong></p><p>Open Google Meet and click <strong>new meeting</strong> to host a meeting.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You may also join the meeting using the invitation code or invite link.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Locate the whiteboard.</strong></p><p>Click on the <strong>three dots</strong> at the bottom of your screen and select <strong>the whiteboard</strong> at the top of the menu list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-whiteboard.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet whiteboard"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Create Whiteboard</strong></p><p>Click on the <strong>start a new whiteboard</strong> option**.**</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This will create a Jam that can be used to visualize ideas on a whiteboard.

Thus, it is recommended to use third-party tools for using the whiteboard feature. In this case, you have to share your screen in the Google Meet session and then navigate to the third-party app having a built-in whiteboard. However, the participants will not be able to make any changes on the whiteboard, and they can only watch the visuals of your screen. Are you an iPhone user and want to use whiteboard apps? If yes, the following step-by-step guide will help you.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download the Microsoft whiteboard app</strong></p><p>Navigate the Microsoft app in the app store and click install.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Join Google meeting room and share screen</strong></p><p>Click three dots at the bottom and select share screen. Press the <strong>start sharing</strong> button to confirm the action.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Use whiteboard in the Microsoft app</strong></p><p>Go to your home page and launch the Microsoft Whiteboard.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Since you will be sharing the screen of your iPhone, participants will be able to see your whiteboard activity.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Use-a-Whiteboard-in-Google-Meet-on-an-Android-Device-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Use-a-Whiteboard-in-Google-Meet-on-an-Android-Device-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Use a Whiteboard in Google Meet on an Android Device"></a><strong>Part 4: How to Use a Whiteboard in Google Meet on an Android Device</strong></h2><p>Similar to iPhone, you cannot use the in-built Jamboard Google Meet tool on Android devices. Even if you try accessing Google Meet from the browser on your android phone, you are likely to be redirected to Google Meet, where there is no whiteboard option. So, the only way out is to download an external whiteboard app from Playstore and use its whiteboard. Your whiteboard activity will be visible to other participants in a Google Meet session when you share the screen. However, this option is only viable if you are the only one illustrating on the whiteboard and no other participants are required to perform any whiteboard activity. If this works for you, follow the step-by-step guide below.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download the Whiteboard application</strong></p><p><strong>Find the Whiteboard app on the Google Playstore and click install</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Join Meeting and Share screen</strong></p><p><strong>Click new meeting and press dots at the bottom of your screen.

You have to screen record on Dell laptop when you want to make a tutorial video and post online. In fact, you can even screen record your gameplay on your Dell laptop and upload on video streaming platforms.</p><p>In order to screen record Dell laptop, you will need a screen recorder. There are free as well as premium screen recorders available. If you do not want to get a dedicated screen recorder application on your Dell laptop, you can opt for an online screen recorder as well. In this article, we have illustrated how to screen record on Dell laptop in all possible ways.</p><h2 id="Way-1-Record-with-Game-Bar"><a href="#Way-1-Record-with-Game-Bar" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Record with Game Bar"></a>Way 1. Record with Game Bar</h2><p>You most likely have Windows 10 installed on your Dell laptop. Windows 10 comes with an inbuilt screen recorder called Game Bar. You can record your screen as well as capture screenshots as per your requirements. You even capture your system as well as external mic audio. Besides, you can view your system performance from its widget. After capturing a screenshot, you can copy and paste it anywhere. Besides, you can share it on Twitter instantly. Here are the steps on how to record screen on Dell laptop using Windows Game Bar.</p><p>Step 1: Press Windows + G keys to open Game Bar on your Dell laptop screen.</p><p>Step 2: Prepare the screen that you want to record. Once you are ready, click on the Record button on the Capture toolbar to start recording. Alternatively, you can press Windows + Alt + R keys together to start recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-bar-dell-laptop-screen.jpg"                      alt="game bar dell laptop screen"                ></p><p>Step 3: Press Windows + Alt + R together again to stop recording.

Use VLC Screen Recorder"></a>Way 2. Use VLC Screen Recorder</h2><p>Even though Windows Media Player is the default medial player on Windows, users prefer VLC Media Player over Windows Media Player. This is because VLC Media Player supports more file formats and there are more customizable settings available such as boosting audio sound. Most importantly, you can use VLC Media Player to record your screen on Dell laptop and view the recorded video instantly on VLC Media Player as well. Here are the steps to screen record Dell laptop using VLC Media Player as screen recorder.</p><p>Step 1: Open VLC Media Player and go to Media&gt; Convert&#x2F;Save option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="vlc screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 2: Go to Capture Device tab and change Capture Mode to Desktop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-capture-device-tab.jpg"                      alt="vlc capture device tab"                ></p><p>Step 3: Under Destination section, click on Browser to select the destination folder as well as mention the destination file name.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-destination-section.jpg"                      alt="vlc destination section"                ></p><p>Step 4: Finally, click on Start button to start recording your screen.

Use Screencast-O-Matic to Record Dell"></a>Way 4. Use Screencast-O-Matic to Record Dell</h2><p>If you do not want a dedicated screen recorder for your Dell laptop, you can use an online screen recorder to capture your screen on your Dell laptop.

A person can also modify your screencast. You can also add text, transitions, use zoom, and more. This player can also access films from the iCloud drive, effectively allowing you to view your online collection everywhere.</p><p>QuickTime is an excellent player, as long as you are not concerned about additional formats. MP4 is the most typical video type, and thus, most videos you’ll find will be compatible with QT. QuickTime Professional is able to create screen songs, edit clips and convert them to music form. However, QuickTime is restricted in other regards – for example, it has no superior music controls.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-player-new-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="quicktime player"                ></p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Screen recording, modifying, conversion with QuickTime Pro</li><li>Look at both local and iCloud documents</li><li>May be fully handled with gestures</li><li>Suitable for Encompass Sound</li><li>Discovers all episodes of a show by checking filenames</li><li>Configurable playback rate and PiP Environment</li></ul><h3 id="CamStudio-3"><a href="#CamStudio-3" class="headerlink" title="CamStudio"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >CamStudio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>CamStudio is one of the top alternatives to VLC. It has an easy-to-use user interface, less file crowding, and low ram memory consumption. Being a professional, you can save a simple 100 dollars by using CamStudio freeware, and it is number one right now. Yet, CamStudio isn’t the only competitor on the market, fortunately. Some of the features fell brief in CamStudio. Functions such as reflexing and frame rate optimization. Versatility in video formats and capturing the display in real-time are also not present.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camstudio-screen-record.jpg"                      alt="camstudio"                ></p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The user interface can be personalized</li><li>HDR tone features</li><li>Decoders can be toggled</li><li>Full subtitle support, allow several simultaneously</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Getting a screen recorder for PC is not terribly difficult, but finding great free ones is more difficult. VLC has a lot of alternatives nowadays, and new opportunities. Keeping a quantity of needs in mind, we now have chosen the programs that can deliver better performance. That’s all it takes to create a quick recording of your screen. VLC won’t offer advanced features like dedicated recorders, but it’s user friendly in a touch. Now you can share what’s on your screen anytime, no more using your phone’s camera! When you’re looking for even more options, Filmora is available free of charge!</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"
