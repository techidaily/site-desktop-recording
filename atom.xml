Programmers are inventing more applications to make our life easier. Similarly, the invention of youtube is one of its prevalent examples of all inventions. Billions of people are watching youtube, among them, millions are video streamers. Today Youtubers and other platform streamers are building costly computational machines to stream their videos with high resolutions and frames per second but it’s not the case for everyone like you and I cannot afford to build those high-end PC or Laptops.</p><p>Therefore, after vast research on the internet, our team came up with an optimal solution to show you a way to stream your videos lag-free, jitter-free, and without any blurriness in a costless way possible. We recommend you the best studio software known as OBS for your streaming using the best OBS settings for your low-end PC or a Laptop. These OBS settings will let you record videos for low-end PC or laptops to stream now without any issues. Keeping things in a little hurry let’s straight dive into the real stuff of this article.</p><h2 id="1-Video-Settings"><a href="#1-Video-Settings" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Settings"></a>1. Video Settings</h2><p>Since we are concerned about the streaming of video. It is important to know how to set up your videos settings. To set your video settings you need to follow the steps given below.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Go-to-Settings"><a href="#Step-1-Go-to-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Go to Settings"></a>Step 1: Go to Settings</h3><p>First, you will need to launch your OBS software. On the main menu, you have to go to file-&gt; settings. You will see a new window will pop up for settings as shown in the figure below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-video-settings-go-to-settings.jpg"                      alt="obs video settings go to settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012401/19272" target="_top" id="2012401">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012401" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012401/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-2-Settings-That-You-Should-Keep"><a href="#Step-2-Settings-That-You-Should-Keep" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Settings That You Should Keep"></a>Step 2: Settings That You Should Keep</h3><p>Starting with base resolution, it is the video resolution that we are going to send to the people who are going to watch our stream. So for the best one, click on it and choose <strong>1280*720</strong>.</p><p>Output tab, which is the resolution of the video that the people will watch. For fast and lag-free streaming it’s best to keep both the output and base resolution the same to avoid any conversion between the resolution by CPU. So click on output resolution and choose <strong>1280*720</strong> again. If you noticed your computer is still lagging then it’s best to change to 480p but below this, it’s not recommended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-settings-that-you-should-keep.jpg"                      alt="obs settings that you should keep"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1834906">                    <video width="864" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834906.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1834906">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834906.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1834906%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1834906/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>After that, it comes to the filter option. There are multiple filter options in this tab but for a fast and better result, you have to choose the <strong>“bilinear”</strong> filter as shown in the figure below. Finally, when it comes to frame per second you gotta be careful here. The more the fps the more it will put load on your CPU means it will become laggy but it is best to keep it <strong>30 fps</strong>, not more than this and not less than this if you are using a low-end PC or Laptop.</p><h3 id="Step-3-Output-Settings"><a href="#Step-3-Output-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Output Settings"></a>Step 3: Output Settings</h3><p>Once you are done with the general video settings now it’s time you should come to the output settings. For that, you will need to choose the output from the main vertical tab as shown in the figure below in 1. You will see a new window appears with a variety of settings. Now it’s time to choose the advanced setting as shown in 2 in the figure to see all settings to be edited.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-output-settings-edited.jpg"                      alt="obs output settings edited"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100526/7443" target="_top" id="2100526">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100526" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Let’s move towards the detail settings for the output video for your audience it’s best to choose the settings shown in the figure and below for lag-free and jitter-free video.</p><p><strong>Encoder:</strong></p><p>The first setting is the encoder setting for your output video. There are two options for it, if you are not using any NVidia graphics card and relying on CPU then it is best to choose x264, which will utilize your CPU.</p><p><strong>Rescale Output:</strong></p><p>The rescale output settings should be kept the same as 720p of the video you are streaming.</p><p><strong>Rate Control:</strong></p><p>Keep the rate control CBR.</p><p><strong>Bitrate:</strong></p><p>Normally, for low-end PCs, you should keep the bitrate to 3000 kbps. However, if you are finding it struggling with your PC in the form of a lag or jitteriness then it’s recommended to drop it low till you get the better results. For the NVIDIA card keep the bitrate to 3000 as it is perfectly fine for it.</p><p><strong>CPU Usage Preset:</strong></p><p>It comes with a lot of options to keep your CPU usage for the video. It is best recommended to keep the CPU usage very fast for good results. If you are using an NVIDIA graphics card then it is best to change the CPU usage to “performance” to get the best out of your machine.</p><p><strong>Profile:</strong></p><p>By default, the profile option is disabled and you should keep these settings as it is if you are not using the NVIDIA card but if it’s not so then it’s recommended to choose the “main” on the profiling option.</p><p>So that’s it for the video settings. These are all the settings that you need to adjust before streaming. After doing it so you just need to click apply button below and bingo it is done.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037334/7443" target="_top" id="2037334">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037334" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037334/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Audio-Settings"><a href="#2-Audio-Settings" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio Settings"></a>2. Audio Settings</h2><p>For a clear and better audio performance, it’s also necessary you keep the optimum settings for the audio too. Well, you don’t have to worry now about the audio too. After reading this article you should keep the same audio settings here for your PC or Laptop.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Output-Audio"><a href="#Step-1-Output-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Output Audio"></a>Step 1: Output Audio</h3><p>The audio settings can be adjusted from two places. Let us discuss the first one. For that, you will need to select the output in the vertical tab and go to audio as shown in the figure below. You will see multiple tracks in these windows. It contains the audio settings for multiple sources. However, if you are using a single it’s good to choose 320 in track one. For multiple, there is no need to change the audio track but to keep the same 320. These are the perfect settings for most cases of the audio settings for your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-output-audio-settings-adjust.jpg"                      alt="obs output audio settings adjust"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Audio-Tab-Settings"><a href="#Step-2-Audio-Tab-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Audio Tab Settings"></a>Step 2: Audio Tab Settings</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-audio-tab-settings-steps.jpg"                      alt="obs audio tab settings steps"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884021/19272" target="_top" id="1884021">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884021" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884021/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The audio consists of many settings,it is divided into categories lets start one by one and explain it.</p><p><strong>Sample Rate and Channels:</strong></p><p>It is the resolution of the audio. The more the sampling rate the more the bits of the audio you sent which means the more the quality of the audio improves. However, there is no need to keep it high but an optimum value works well too. Therefore, keep it <strong>48khz</strong> for the best result as shown. Another thing is a channel, which contains a lot of options but most of you will want the <strong>“stereo”</strong> since it’s the most common choice from the streamers.</p><p><strong>Desktop Audios:</strong></p><p>The desktop audio depends on the device you are using for the audio. It is best to use the default if you don’t know about your device otherwise choose USB if you are audio uses the USB port. For the second audio source, you can choose desktop audio 2 and set it accordingly.</p><p><strong>Auxiliary Audio:</strong></p><p>The streamers usually have one mic source but if you have multiple mic sources then you choose up to 4 auxiliary audio ports and set the device’s settings.</p><p><strong>Meter: Decay Rate &amp; Peak Meter Type:</strong></p><p>The meter is a decibel meter (dB). It is a measurement of volume. The more the decibels, the more it is loud. So use the decay rate to choose between fast, medium, and slow volumes accordingly to your needs. The Peak Meter type is used for your CPU usage. IF you have set higher CPU usage then go for the “true peak” otherwise chose “sample peak”.</p><p>Finally, the rest of the options should be kept as default since being a streamer you won’t need them to change and they are pretty much basic hotkeys to set up if you wish to.</p><h2 id="3-Stream-Settings"><a href="#3-Stream-Settings" class="headerlink" title="3.

You can tweak the parameters on video quality so that you can get the recording just like you want.</p><p><strong>Webcam Capture</strong> - OBS lets you add webcam as an overlay so that you can record your gameplay as well as show your reaction so that the recording is more interactive and engaging. You can also use green screen setup to make the video more professional and eye-catching.</p><p><strong>Better Audio</strong> - You can record your game sound as well as your voice from external mic. This is useful for voiceover and live commentary to make the video interesting and showcase your personality traits verbally. There are also audio filters, audio mixers, and audio effects available to apply.</p><p><strong>Advanced Editor</strong> - The built-in editing software allows performing different post-recording tasks like sharpening, cropping, and color correction.

Comparison ShadowPlay vs OBS"></a>Part 2. Comparison ShadowPlay vs OBS</h2><p>Here are the key points of differences between OBS and ShadowPlay that will help you decide between OBS or ShadowPlay.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS</strong> <strong>Recording:</strong></p><p>While recording, OBS allows faster processing of the recorded video files. Besides, it can compress the file size during the encoding process so that the recorded video files take relatively less space. This makes it ideal for longer sessions of gameplay recording. However, in the process, OBS can reduce the frame rate significantly, and hence, the video may not be as smooth as you expect it to be. Therefore, OBS is suitable for regular game recording where not much compression is required.</p><p>On the contrary, ShadowPlay does not reduce the file size or frame rate, and hence, it is a great choice for high-end games where you need the recorded to be as smooth as possible. However, ShadowPlay requires more space on the hard drive. When you upload on video streaming platforms, there will be some automatic compression. Therefore, the less compression you do during your encoding phase, the better will be the output.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Performance:</strong></p><p>OBS uses significant CPU power and resources. This is one of the reasons why it reduces the frame rate while recording to use less CPU resources. In fact, it can affect the game performance if you are playing and recording a high-end game. However, you can customize various configuration parameters to reduce its burden on CPU performance.</p><p>ShadowPlay does not affect the CPU performance as it comes with hardware acceleration. It supports higher frame rates for high-end games as well. If at all, it can bring about 5%-10% effect on CPU performance which is almost ignorable in comparison to OBS.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS File Format</strong>:</p><p>OBS consumes less space for recorded videos. It compresses the format which can drastically reduce the output file size. The best thing about OBS is that it comes with the NVENC hardware encoded chip that allows choosing from different supported file formats.</p><p>On the contrary, ShadowPlay supports MP4 formats by default which makes it require more space. It uses  codec. MP4 file format is the most popular video file format that you can play across all media players and upload on online platforms.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Live Streaming</strong>:</p><p>You cannot live stream as well as record on ShadowPlay. This is a major drawback that OBS has overcome. That is why most gamers prefer OBS Studio for live streaming as they can record the gaming session for future reference. If you want to just broadcast your gameplay, ShadowPlay is good enough. But if you want to have multiple scenes and overlay adjustments in live streaming, OBS is the best choice.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Editing:</strong></p><p>OBS offers better editing options thanks to its built-in editor. Starting customizable transitions to real-time editing before broadcasting, OBS has different editing scopes tailor-made for gamers. On the contrary, ShadowPlay has very limited editing options as the main focus is on recording only. But if we talk about true video editing, both applications are still underdeveloped on this front.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Alternative-Way-To-Record-Games"><a href="#Part-3-Alternative-Way-To-Record-Games" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Today, anyone with enough knowledge about a certain topic can create a tutorial, a Slideshare presentation or video lessons from the comfort of their homes. All they need is a computer and a screencasting software that enables them to capture the desktop screen.</p><p>The amount of possibilities screencasting offers is nearly limitless and what type of screencast video you are going to make depends almost entirely on your creativity. However, before you embark on this adventure, there are a few things you should know about screencasting software, which is why we are going to provide you with all the information you’ll need to choose the right screencasting software.</p><ul><li><a href="#advantage">Part 1: Why Using Screencasting?</a></li><li><a href="#pick">Part 2: How to Pick Screencasting software?</a></li><li><a href="#choose">Part 3: Which screencasting software should I choose?</a></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1030129/11832" target="_top" id="1030129">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1030129" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1030129/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-The-Advantages-of-Using-Screencasting-Software"><a href="#Part-1-The-Advantages-of-Using-Screencasting-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The Advantages of Using Screencasting Software"></a>Part 1: The Advantages of Using Screencasting Software</h2><p>What type of screencast videos you are going to make depends on what you want to communicate. For example, large companies can easily make screencasts to welcome their new team members and walk them through their new duties. In this manner, producing a screencast can save time that can be invested in more pressing issues than the guiding of the newcomers through each step of their new job.</p><p>Furthermore, a screencast can serve as a guide that answers all sorts of frequently asked questions. Instead of writing detailed explanations that take a lot of time to read, you can create a screencast that can be shared as many times you want or posted on your website to help users of your products get all the answers they need.</p><p>Screencasts can be utilized as an effective way to make attractive sales pitches, product demos, software walk-throughs and even for giving the feedback to your clients or customers. In addition, screencast videos can be used for educational purposes, since a screencast is a perfect tool for the production of a tutorial on literally any subject you can think of.</p><p>To make things even better, screencasts can be used for fun, because capturing the gameplay of your favorite video game and sharing it online is easy, all you need is a great screencasting software and you can share your gaming skills with the rest of the world.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896532/19272" target="_top" id="1896532">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896532" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896532/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Key-Features-You-Should-Look-For-When-Picking-the-Screencasting-Software"><a href="#Part-2-Key-Features-You-Should-Look-For-When-Picking-the-Screencasting-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Key Features You Should Look For When Picking the Screencasting Software?"></a>Part 2: Key Features You Should Look For When Picking the Screencasting Software?</h2><p>Your ideas will not look as good in the real world as they did when you imagined them if you don’t have the right tools to produce them. That is why picking the right screencasting software capable of high-end performances is so important. You can find a lot of material on the Internet about the best screencasting options currently available on the market, but the information about the features you have to consider before you purchase a software that enables you to produce screencasts is often scarce.</p><p>Testing each software you find in the top ten articles will take too much of your time, so instead, you should take a close look at the list of the software’s features and make sure that its video recording and video editing options are powerful enough to create visually impressive videos. Here are the key features you should pay close attention to when choosing your new screencasting software.</p><h4 id="1-Capture-options"><a href="#1-Capture-options" class="headerlink" title="1. Capture options"></a>1. Capture options</h4><p>The amount of creative freedom provided by the software’s capture options is directly related to the quality of screencasts you’ll be able to make. If the software you are using doesn’t allow you to specify the area of the screen you want to capture or if it can only produce low-quality videos, then the screen recorder you are thinking of buying is not your best option. A good screencasting software should offer plenty of different video file sizes, audio recording options as well as the option to record footage with your webcam while simultaneously capturing the screen of your computer.</p><h4 id="2-Video-and-audio-editing-tools"><a href="#2-Video-and-audio-editing-tools" class="headerlink" title="2. Video and audio editing tools"></a>2. Video and audio editing tools</h4><p>We all make mistakes, the important thing is to know how to correct them. Almost all screen recordings need to go through the video editing process, simply because they often contain mistakes that shouldn’t be included in the final cut of the video. Audio editing options are equally important, since you can accidentally record background noises during a screen capturing session, and being able to remove them right away without using pricy audio editing software can save you a lot of money.</p><h4 id="3-How-easy-is-it-to-use"><a href="#3-How-easy-is-it-to-use" class="headerlink" title="3. How easy is it to use?"></a>3. How easy is it to use?</h4><p>You don’t have to be a film industry professional in order to be able to use a screen recording software, although some of these computer programs are needlessly complicated and require a professional level of video making skills. The screen capturing process should be simple and fun, which is why it is better to choose the screencasting software that enables you to set up the screen recording sessions quickly.</p><h4 id="4-Saving-capacity"><a href="#4-Saving-capacity" class="headerlink" title="4. Saving capacity"></a>4. Saving capacity</h4><p>How good a screen recording software really is, depends on its video output options. The size options for the video files you are making when capturing a screen, the number of different video file formats in which that file can be saved or the software’s export options should all play a role in the process of making a decision which screencasting software you should buy. Look for screencasting software products that allow you to save your videos in commonly used file formats like MP.4 or that use  encoder, because you may experience problems if you try to upload AVI or WMW video files to an online video sharing platform.</p><p>Exporting video files directly from the software to YouTube of Twitch is a huge advantage since it allows to save an enormous amount of time on waiting for the files to be exported from the software and then upload them to the Internet.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997680/19272" target="_top" id="1997680">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997680" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997680/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-So-Which-Screencasting-Software-Should-You-Choose"><a href="#Part-3-So-Which-Screencasting-Software-Should-You-Choose" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: So, Which Screencasting Software Should You Choose?"></a>Part 3: So, Which Screencasting Software Should You Choose?</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p>We’ve covered just a fraction of the factors that must be taken into account before deciding to purchase a certain screencasting software product. Paying attention to frame rates as well as live broadcast features can help you narrow down the list of screen recorders worth considering. The type of screencast you want to make should also help you decide which software to buy because if you just want to make a short screen recording you don’t really need the<strong>HD</strong> option, so buying a software that lets you create <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>4K</strong></a> videos isn’t the right choice for you. On the other hand, if the video quality is your priority, then a 4K video option is a must, but the number of Annotations the software product offers may not be so important.</p><p>A good Screencasting software should be well-equipped, user-friendly and easy to use, since its main purpose is to make the screen recording process effortless, so you can focus on the quality of the content you are producing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135350/19272" target="_top" id="2135350">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135350" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135350/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-choosing-between-obs-and-streamlabs-for-broadcast-excellence/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Choosing Between OBS and Streamlabs for Broadcast Excellence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-strategies-for-perfect-screenshots-at-your-fingertips/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Strategies for Perfect Screenshots at Your Fingertips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-razers-hd-webcam-thorough-review-guide/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Razer's HD Webcam Thorough Review Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-critical-analysis-of-the-best-free-video-chat-software-suitable-for-businesses-and-educators/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Critical Analysis of the Best Free Video Chat Software Suitable for Businesses & Educators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-sourav-joshis-income-tactics-the-future-of-monetizing-content-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Sourav Joshi's Income Tactics The Future of Monetizing Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-vdq-quickscreen-recorder-report-in-depth-analysis/"><u>[Updated] VDQ QuickScreen Recorder Report In-Depth Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/a-working-guide-for-pachirisu-pokemon-go-map-on-tecno-spark-10-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>A Working Guide For Pachirisu Pokemon Go Map On Tecno Spark 10 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/boost-your-laptop-onoff-trick-for-energy-conservation/"><u>Boost Your Laptop: On/Off Trick for Energy Conservation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/capture-every-word-in-high-fidelity-with-discord-for-2024/"><u>Capture Every Word in High Fidelity with Discord for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-on-xiaomi-14-ultra-devices-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Bypass Google FRP Lock on Xiaomi 14 Ultra Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/mastering-mov-to-mpeg-4-conversion-on-win-11-for-2024/"><u>Mastering MOV to MPEG-4 Conversion on Win 11 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/premium-portable-switch-game-clones-for-2024/"><u>Premium Portable Switch Game Clones for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/what-does-enter-puk-code-mean-and-why-did-the-sim-get-puk-blocked-on-realme-narzo-60-5g-device-by-drfone-android/"><u>What Does Enter PUK Code Mean And Why Did The Sim Get PUK Blocked On Realme Narzo 60 5G Device</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Chill, you don’t need a professional studio for this purpose. There is a lot of software, but zoom podcast recording is relatively more straightforward. A podcast is a collection of audio files that you can either download or listen to online using the internet. This article will help you learn to record podcasts using zoom.</p><h2 id="7-Step-Formula-How-To-Record-a-Podcast-on-Zoom"><a href="#7-Step-Formula-How-To-Record-a-Podcast-on-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="7-Step Formula: How To Record a Podcast on Zoom?"></a>7-Step Formula: How To Record a Podcast on Zoom?</h2><p>Recording a podcast on zoom is quite simple and easy. You don’t need to be a recording expert; you can get it done at home using your laptop. In this article, I will guide you on how to record a podcast using zoom step by step.</p><h5 id="Step1-Download-and-Install"><a href="#Step1-Download-and-Install" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Download and Install"></a>Step1 Download and Install</h5><p>The 1st step is downloading and installing zoom on your device. Next, create your zoom account by visiting the <a class="link"   href="https://soft-portal.shop/zoom/?url=https://zoom.us&id=5&geo=&ub=https://soft-portal.shop/zoom/&gclid=Cj0KCQjw48OaBhDWARIsAMd966AtsDXlasyuqO9r1vrbTzSdxKyOMLNsfNLa_RFZ12PRcu09P4sKnMcaAlUHEALw_wcB" >zoom website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Log in to this account with your installed software and enjoy zoom free. The free version allows you to record for 40 minutes. For longer calls, purchase the paid version.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-1.jpg"                      alt="download and install zoom"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Setting-Up-Microphone-and-Headphones"><a href="#Step2-Setting-Up-Microphone-and-Headphones" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Setting Up Microphone and Headphones"></a>Step2 Setting Up Microphone and Headphones</h5><p>Zoom can use your device’s built-in microphone, but it is advised to use a high-quality external mic. It enhances the quality of your podcast tremendously. Plenty of external mics are available for under 50$, which can make a real difference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-2.jpg"                      alt="set up microphone and headphones"                ></p><h5 id="Step3-Eliminate-Any-Background-Noise"><a href="#Step3-Eliminate-Any-Background-Noise" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Eliminate Any Background Noise"></a>Step3 Eliminate Any Background Noise</h5><p>No one is interested in listening to what’s happening in the background while listening to your podcast. So, before pressing the ‘Record’ button, ensure your environment is as quiet as possible. You can take the following steps to reduce background noises.</p><ul><li>Turn off the fan, air conditioner, or any other noisy appliances.</li><li>Remove noisy kids, roommates, or pets.</li><li>Hang a ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign on your front door.</li><li>Shut your door and windows to avoid noise from outside sources, such as sirens, traffic horns, etc.</li><li>Avoid the rustling sound of paper or moving things around your desk.</li><li>Install noise-canceling software to filter out any background noise.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-3.jpg"                      alt="eliminate background noise"                ></p><h5 id="Step4-Set-Up-Separate-Audio-Tracks-for-Each-Speaker"><a href="#Step4-Set-Up-Separate-Audio-Tracks-for-Each-Speaker" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Set Up Separate Audio Tracks for Each Speaker"></a>Step4 Set Up Separate Audio Tracks for Each Speaker</h5><p>Wouldn’t it be easier to edit your podcast if you recorded audio tracks for each speaker separately? Zoom has this feature of recording separate audio tracks.</p><p>To enable this, go to your zoom ‘Settings’ and click on the ‘Recording’ setting. Then select “Record a separate audio file for each participant,” and you are ready to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-4.jpg"                      alt="separate audio tracks for each speaker"                ></p><h5 id="Step5-Brief-Your-Guest-About-Zoom-Functioning-Before-You-Begin"><a href="#Step5-Brief-Your-Guest-About-Zoom-Functioning-Before-You-Begin" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Brief Your Guest About Zoom Functioning Before You Begin"></a>Step5 Brief Your Guest About Zoom Functioning Before You Begin</h5><p>If you are going live and your guest is new to zoom, it is better that you guide him briefly about the functioning of zoom. Guide your guest on how to join the call using zoom. It would be best if you also told him about the duration and topic of your podcast.</p><p>It is advised to test the microphone and headphones of your guest before starting a live podcast. Your guest does not need to download and install zoom on their device; he can join by clicking the link and entering the call from his browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-5.jpg"                      alt="brief the guest about zoom functioning"                ></p><h5 id="Step6-Record-the-Call-Using-Zoom"><a href="#Step6-Record-the-Call-Using-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Record the Call Using Zoom"></a>Step6 Record the Call Using Zoom</h5><p>It is pretty simple to record a podcast using zoom.

Please make sure everyone’s microphone is working and their voices are clear.</li><li>Click on the participant name you want to make a co-host and press the make co-host button.</li><li>Click the ‘Record’ button and turn on ‘Original Sound’ to start recording the podcast.</li><li>When the podcast is complete, click on the ‘End’ button and then click on ‘End Meeting for All.’</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-6.jpg"                      alt="record the call using zoom"                ></p><h5 id="Step7-Edit-the-Audio-File-Using-Editing-Tools"><a href="#Step7-Edit-the-Audio-File-Using-Editing-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Step7 Edit the Audio File Using Editing Tools"></a>Step7 Edit the Audio File Using Editing Tools</h5><p>At the end of the recording session, you will get two different file types. An MP4 audio file that you can edit using audio editors and an MP4 video file that you can edit and post on youtube or any other social media platform.</p><p>If you have recorded separate audio tracks for each speaker, you will get separate MP4 audio files for each speaker with that person’s name. You can edit the audio tracks with professional podcast editing software, like Audacity editor or Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/zoom-podcasts-recording-7.jpg"                      alt="edit audio using editor"                ></p><p>We have discussed how to use zoom for recording podcasts, and now we will look at the benefits of using zoom to record podcasts.</p><h3 id="The-Benefits-of-Using-Zoom-To-Record-Your-Podcasts"><a href="#The-Benefits-of-Using-Zoom-To-Record-Your-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="The Benefits of Using Zoom To Record Your Podcasts"></a>The Benefits of Using Zoom To Record Your Podcasts</h3><ul><li>You can host any podcast on zoom- a solo one where you are the speaker, hosting a speaker, or co-hosting with another podcaster.</li><li>Co-host with anyone you want with a particular social distancing meanwhile.</li><li>Share the screen with the attendees in just a few clicks.</li><li>Built-in feature splits audio and video and makes editing much more accessible.</li><li>Can accommodate multiple participants when there are more speakers</li><li>The audience may feel more involved in the discussion.</li></ul><h2 id="Limitations-of-Using-Zoom-for-Podcasts"><a href="#Limitations-of-Using-Zoom-for-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of Using Zoom for Podcasts"></a>Limitations of Using Zoom for Podcasts</h2><p>Having discussed the method to record podcasts with zoom and the benefits of using zoom, we will now discuss the limitations of zoom for podcast recording. Of course, every software has its limits, and so does zoom, and these limitations are discussed below.</p><h3 id="●-Audio-and-Video-Quality"><a href="#●-Audio-and-Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="● Audio and Video Quality"></a>● Audio and Video Quality</h3><p> Zoom’s priority is virtual conferencing, which compromises audio and video quality to optimize the speed and smoothness of calling. Besides, the recording audio and video quality depend upon your internet speed. If your internet is slow, you will experience lag and interruptions in your recorded podcasts.</p><h3 id="●-Compressed-Audio-and-Video"><a href="#●-Compressed-Audio-and-Video" class="headerlink" title="● Compressed Audio and Video"></a>● Compressed Audio and Video</h3><p>Zoom compresses your audio and video files by removing portions of audio tracks making the file smaller. Audio compression makes your video chat smooth, but the resulting recorded file is of low quality for professional use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134492/18498" target="_top" id="2134492">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134492" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134492/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="●-Time-limit"><a href="#●-Time-limit" class="headerlink" title="● Time limit"></a>● Time limit</h3><p>With the free plan, you can make calls for a maximum of 40 minutes.

The AtomMan G7 Pt, however, is somewhere in-between as a Mini PC featuring mobile processors.

Nevertheless, they should do a pretty good job delivering a capable mini gaming system experience, as long as user ambitions for higher resolutions (like 4K) and raytracing are kept in check.</p><p> Another thing that needs to be carefully kept in check in a mini system is cooling. Minisforum touts the capabilities of its Cold Wave Ultra cooling system, which uses “a vertical single heat pipe with dual air inlets in series and dual-sided quad fans.” Complementing the processor cooling, it has also fitted “an enhanced DDR&#x2F;SSD active cooler and dual liquid metal 8-heat pipe separated link.” The firm claims the cooling fitted into the AtomMan G7 Pt can cope with up to 205W, without fan noise breaching 45dB.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> Other aspects of the interior specs worth commenting on are the device’s easy upgrades with twin DDR5-5200 SODOMM slots for up to 96GB RAM. Also, it has two M.2 storage slots (PCIe5.0 and PCIe4.0), and a socketed wireless card.</p><p> Connectivity seems pretty good for such a small box. As well as Wi-Fi 7 there is a 2.5G Ethernet port, and you can connect up to three 4K monitors at once (HDMI, DP, and USB-C). Six USB ports are available in total, with all being USB 3.2 Gen2 rated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5vH5yUKbtEt5tHuJMtPYk5-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan G7 Pt"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p> One of the bigger changes we have seen added to the AtomMan G7 Pt since its name was switched from the HX200G is the provision of dual RGB backlighting panels.

The Enterprise video market’s current size exceeds $16 billion and it is expected to reach $40 billion by 2022. These numbers show that communication through videos is becoming increasingly popular in business contexts and that their significance for the success of a business is going to continue rising in the foreseeable future.</p><p>In April 2015 Microsoft has launched <a class="link"   href="https://products.office.com/en/business/explore-office-365-video" >Office 365 Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, a video sharing platform that has been replaced by <a class="link"   href="https://stream.microsoft.com/en-us/" >Microsoft Stream <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> just two years later.

Taking Game Screenshots with Game Bar on Windows 10</h4><p>If you are not interested in installing any additional tool on your gaming PC, it is even possible to capture high-quality game screenshots using Game Bar. While playing an adventure game, you first need to open the game bar; but it is easy to do with keyboard-based shortcuts. Simply press, Windows + Alt + Print Screen or it can also be done by hitting Windows + G keys.

You can alter the shortcut keys by switching to Settings, then Gaming and finally Game Bar. As soon as you capture a screenshot using Game Bar, the system shows an instant notification “Screenshot saved,” it appears on the bottom right corner of the screen.

Taking Screenshots Using In-Game Shortcuts</h4><p>In case if you are not playing games on Steam, it is still possible to capture screenshots with many built-in shortcuts and screenshot functions. In most of the games, the screenshot can be captured instantly using “Print Screen” key; however, few games may follow other settings for screen capture. As soon as you tap the key in question, the game will instantly save a screenshot at a specific location on the disk. For example, in all Blizzard’s Battle.net games, the Print Screen key always helps to capture a screenshot, and they can be later found in a hard drive-based folder. However, the folder name can be different for every game; for example, if you capture a screenshot while playing Overwatch, it will be saved at folder location: Documents\Overwatch\Screenshots\Overwatch. You can perform a web search to know the suitable screenshot key for every game. This information can also be obtained from the shortcut configuration menu.</p><h4 id="3-Taking-Screenshots-Using-Steam’s-Shortcut"><a href="#3-Taking-Screenshots-Using-Steam’s-Shortcut" class="headerlink" title="3.

As soon as you press the key, a shutter sound will be heard on the system and a notification saying “Screenshot Saved” will appear instantly on the bottom right corner of PC screen.</p><p>In case if you do not find F12 key easier to access during your games, you can also customize this key by going to Steam Interface section.

If you want to view the captured screenshots, open them using Shift + Tab key on Steam Overlay; or if you have altered the settings on Steam, it can be done using your custom shortcut on the keyboard. Finally, click “View Screenshots” button on the overlay.</p><p>If you want to see your screenshots after exiting the game, you will find them on Steam library by opening game page.

Note that, this option works only with few specific games, only if the developer has added support for this feature. However, there are many popular games in the list that support Nvidia Ansel feature like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Middle-Earth: Shadow of War, Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice, Dishonored 2, etc.</p><p>When you are playing the game, simply hit Alt + F2 key and the gameplay will instantly freeze; along with this, “Ansel” sidebar will appear on the screen.

In-depth Review"></a>3. In-depth Review</h2><p>Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.</p><p>Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.</p><p>Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.</p><p>Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p><p>Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.</p><h2 id="4-Best-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4.

Comparison of OBS vs Bandicam"></a>Part 3. Comparison of OBS vs Bandicam</h2><p>Here is a detailed comparison of OBS Studio and Bandicam that will definitely help you to which video recording software you should opt for.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong></p><p>The user interface is the main difference between the two popular recording applications. The user interface of OBS can be too overwhelming for a beginner. It takes considerable time to get used to and find the required options instantly. In fact, you may have to go through tutorial videos to get a proper grip on the software. Owning to the popularity of OBS Studio, there is no dearth of videos and guides on OBS.</p><p>On the contrary, Bandicam has a straightforward and user-friendly interface. This is one of the main reasons why some users ditch OBS and opt for Bandicam by paying the required price. You can get all the options intuitively and adjust all the parameters of video recording instantly. Even a beginner will feel like a pro while using Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Screen Recording:</strong></p><p>Both the applications are tailor-made for screen recording. In terms of settings and customizing parameters, both the applications have the same offering. However, when it comes to customized screen recording such as capturing a portion of the screen, the operation gets easy with Bandicam thanks to its intuitive controls and options.</p><p>Moreover, there are more options available for better screen recording on Bandicam. The mouse clicks are well highlighted, there are options for real-time drawing, and you can even schedule screen recording. Setting up a webcam along with the screen in addition to system and external audio recording is more convenient on Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Game Recording</strong>:</p><p>There is a dedicated option available on Bandicam for game recording. This means setting up your screen and recording parameters is easy on Bandicam when it comes to game recording. On the contrary, there is no dedicated option on OBS and hence, it is the same as recording your screen with OBS. Therefore, in terms of options and easy controls for game recording, Bandicam is a clear winner.</p><p>However, for recording high-end games, you need a considerably high configuration computer for Bandicam. Otherwise, it brings down FPS automatically so that the system does not break down while recording. Besides, for advanced game recording, OBS supports multi-screen recording which is not available on Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Live Streaming</strong>:</p><p>Bandicam is a purely video recording software. There is no option available on Bandicam for live streaming on any platform. Therefore, if you are looking for a video recorder where you can live stream as well, Bandicam should not be your choice and you have to opt for OBS Studio.</p><p>OBS Studio is equally popular in the video creator community as a video recorder as well as a live streaming platform. It is hardly as software available like OBS from where you can live stream on so many different online platforms. Once you have the stream URL and stream key, you are good to go for live streaming from your desktop computer.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-Video"><a href="#Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Otherwise, it brings down FPS automatically so that the system does not break down while recording. Besides, for advanced game recording, OBS supports multi-screen recording which is not available on Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Live Streaming</strong>:</p><p>Bandicam is a purely video recording software. There is no option available on Bandicam for live streaming on any platform. Therefore, if you are looking for a video recorder where you can live stream as well, Bandicam should not be your choice and you have to opt for OBS Studio.</p><p>OBS Studio is equally popular in the video creator community as a video recorder as well as a live streaming platform. It is hardly as software available like OBS from where you can live stream on so many different online platforms. Once you have the stream URL and stream key, you are good to go for live streaming from your desktop computer.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-Video-3"><a href="#Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Alternative Way to Record Screen Video"></a>Part 4. Alternative Way to Record Screen Video</h2><p>If you are not satisfied with OBS for its complicated user interface and you are looking for a better alternative to Bandicam, we recommend Filmora - a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for both PC and Mac.

In terms of features, there is not much difference but Bandicam is significantly use to easy. Bandicam has more options for better screen recording but it lacks useful editing options. If you are looking for a better alternative Bandicam, we recommend Wondershare Filmora and you can record and edit video like a professional.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-maximizing-clarity-fb-messages-full-recording-process/"><u>[New] Maximizing Clarity FB Messages Full Recording Process</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-best-mac-options-to-replace-bandicam/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Best Mac Options to Replace Bandicam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-free-windows-programs-expertly-record-live-shows/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Free Windows Programs Expertly Record Live Shows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mac-acoustic-arena-deep-dive/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Mac Acoustic Arena Deep Dive</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-fast-format-transformation-youtube-for-mac-ratio-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Fast Format Transformation YouTube for Mac Ratio for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-best-way-to-perform-obs-streaming/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Best Way to Perform OBS Streaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-captivating-content-for-the-first-moments-in-audios/"><u>2024 Approved Crafting Captivating Content for the First Moments in Audios</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-studio.techidaily.com/duwelijksbevalling-twee-wegenslagen-voor-het-uitmaken-van-overschrijdelijke-daten-aan-exterieure-hardware/"><u>Duwelijksbevalling: Twee Wegenslagen Voor Het Uitmaken Van Overschrijdelijke Daten Aan Exterieure Hardware</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/easy-to-install-windows-x-vision-software-for-monitor-camera-and-high-quality-sound-recording/"><u>Easy-to-Install Windows X Vision Software for Monitor, Camera, and High-Quality Sound Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/eliminating-unrequested-podcast-episodes-on-spotify-app/"><u>Eliminating Unrequested Podcast Episodes on Spotify App</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-streamlining-video-sequence-assembly-through-blends/"><u>In 2024, Streamlining Video Sequence Assembly Through Blends</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/screensnapper-revisited-apowersofts-latest-pc-tool-for-2024/"><u>ScreenSnapper Revisited Apowersoft's Latest PC Tool for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/the-secrets-to-hassle-free-background-hocus-pocus-on-zoom-for-2024/"><u>The Secrets to Hassle-Free Background Hocus Pocus on Zoom for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/transforma-tu-archivo-tga-en-bmp-sin-gastos-usando-el-servicio-en-linea-gratuito-de-movavi/"><u>Transforma Tu Archivo TGA en BMP Sin Gastos Usando El Servicio en Línea Gratuito De Movavi</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/trouble-free-audio-experience-overcoming-realtek-alc887-hd-driver-glitches-in-windows/"><u>Trouble-Free Audio Experience: Overcoming Realtek ALC887 HD Driver Glitches in Windows</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

So let’s get started.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Preparing Before Making Video Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Using Right Screen Recording Software for Step-by-Step Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Recording Professional Audio</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Capturing Tutorial Video</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Editing Recorded Tutorial Video</a></li><li><a href="#part6">Sharing the Video Tutorial With Your Audiences</a></li><li><a href="#part7">Summary for Next Tutorial Video</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Preparing-for-the-Tutorial-Making-Process-3-Tips"><a href="#Part-1-Preparing-for-the-Tutorial-Making-Process-3-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Preparing for the Tutorial Making Process [3 Tips]"></a>Part 1: Preparing for the Tutorial Making Process [3 Tips]</h2><p>The amount of video content uploaded to the Internet on a daily basis is staggering, to say the least. That’s why your video tutorials need to offer something unique in order to stand out in the sea of similar content. The process of making a tutorial starts long before you hit the record button, and here are a few tips that will help you be prepared for the challenges you might face while making your first video tutorial.</p><h4 id="1-Define-the-Target-Audience-and-Pick-the-Right-Topics"><a href="#1-Define-the-Target-Audience-and-Pick-the-Right-Topics" class="headerlink" title="1. Define the Target Audience and Pick the Right Topics"></a>1. Define the Target Audience and Pick the Right Topics</h4><p>Who are the people you are trying to reach? Finding the answer to this simple question is going to help you solve a variety of common issues video content producers have to deal with. By defining the target audience you’ll be able to discover the best way to approach them.</p><p>What’s more, once you understand who the viewers of your tutorials are, you’ll be able to pick the subjects that spark the most interest within the group you’re targeting. It goes without saying that knowing everything there is to know about the topics you’re covering is an absolute must if you are hoping to attract large audiences to your videos.</p><h4 id="2-Make-a-Content-Plan"><a href="#2-Make-a-Content-Plan" class="headerlink" title="2. Make a Content Plan"></a>2. Make a Content Plan</h4><p>The best way to approach the process of tutorial video production is to define your goals and the course of action long before you start recording. You should write down all the ideas and concepts you have in your head. Once you’ve formulated the concept you’ll be able to see how many videos you have to make in order to cover all the ins and outs of a topic.</p><p>Try to find natural stopping points or thematic units in your list and decide how many videos you’ll have to create so you can offer a comprehensive and informative view on the subject. Including too much information in one video may discourage the viewers to follow the tutorial until the end. You should take into consideration the concept of the cognitive load while deciding how long your videos should be. This concept points out that there’s a limit to how much and how fast an average person can learn, so offering too much information in a single video can end up being counterproductive.</p><p>If the topic of your video tutorial is complex you should provide explanations through practical examples, even if it takes a lot of screen time, rather than jumping from one subject to another. Here are a few tips that will help you figure out how to structure your video tutorial series.</p><p><strong>Your concept must have a clear beginning, middle and the end:</strong> This is a basic rule of storytelling that helps you guide the viewer through the topic of your tutorials. You should use the same principle when recording each video in the series.</p><p><strong>How much time a certain topic demands:</strong> Covering more than one topic in a video is possible, although before you decide to do so, you should make sure that the topics you want to include in the tutorial have something in common.</p><p><strong>How much information is too much:</strong> Keeping the viewer’s attention glued to what’s going on in the tutorial is your primary goal. That’s why you need to find the right measure of information you provide in each video. By offering less information in each video, you’re giving viewers the time to process it and understand it better.</p><p>Once you’ve created thematic units you can proceed to write a script for each video. These scripts don’t have to be detailed, you can just create a few bullet points to guide you through the video.</p><h4 id="3-Record-in-a-Clean-Work-Environment"><a href="#3-Record-in-a-Clean-Work-Environment" class="headerlink" title="3. Record in a Clean Work Environment"></a>3. Record in a Clean Work Environment</h4><p>Everything displayed on your computer’s monitor is going to be recorded, so before you start a screen capturing session make sure that all of your private data is well outside the work environment you’ll be using in the video. Instead of wasting time on concealing private information in the post-production, you can save time by controlling what is visible in the portion of the screen you are capturing.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Choosing-Best-Screen-Recorder-for-Video-Tutorial-Making"><a href="#Part-2-Choosing-Best-Screen-Recorder-for-Video-Tutorial-Making" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Choosing Best Screen Recorder for Video Tutorial Making"></a>Part 2: Choosing <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for Video Tutorial Making</h2><p>Having the right tools for a job is as equally important as knowing exactly how to do a certain job. There are so many different screen recorders on the market at the moment, that choosing the right one isn’t always such an easy task. Most free software products that offer the screencasting feature have limitations that may prevent you from creating a high-quality tutorial.</p><p>If you want to capture videos at high frame rates, select the region of the screen you’re recording by yourself or record high-resolution footage we recommend using Wondershare’s <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Scrn <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Besides featuring powerful screen capturing tools, the software also has a video editing mode, that allows you to edit your videos immediately after you finish a screencasting session. You can use this software to record all your desktop activities on Mac and PC computers for free, and you can purchase the perpetual license to use it for just $29.99 or a one-year license at $19.99.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2126492/26400" target="_top" id="2126492">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2126492" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2126492/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Audio-Recording-A-Few-Tips-for-Recording-Better-Audio"><a href="#Part-3-Audio-Recording-A-Few-Tips-for-Recording-Better-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Audio Recording: A Few Tips for Recording Better Audio"></a>Part 3: Audio Recording: A Few Tips for Recording Better Audio</h2><p>Video tutorials largely depend on narration, because you have to use your voice to explain what is going on in the video. That’s why you have to pay special attention to the quality of sound in your videos. Tutorials with poor audio quality have fewer chances of attracting large audiences, simply because most people don’t want to watch a video if they can’t understand what you are saying. Here’s how you can improve the quality of audio in your video tutorials.</p><h4 id="1-Use-the-right-Microphone"><a href="#1-Use-the-right-Microphone" class="headerlink" title="1. Use the right Microphone"></a>1. Use the right <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Whether or not you should record audio with an external microphone is not the real question you should be asking. The real issue is which type of external microphone you should use. Omnidirectional microphones pick up background noises easily, so in order to record clear and natural narration, you should use a unidirectional microphone that only picks up sounds that are coming from one direction.</p><h4 id="2-Add-Background-Music-if-necessary"><a href="#2-Add-Background-Music-if-necessary" class="headerlink" title="2.Add Background Music if necessary"></a>2.<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Add Background Music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if necessary</h4><p>Music can help you create a pleasant atmosphere in your video tutorials and it can partially cover the background noise. There are numerous websites that grant you access to royalty free music, which means that it shouldn’t be too hard to find the track you want to include in the tutorial. You should just make sure that the voiceover is clearly audible because you don’t want the music to be louder than the narrator’s voice.</p><h4 id="3-Record-in-an-optimized-acoustic-environment"><a href="#3-Record-in-an-optimized-acoustic-environment" class="headerlink" title="3. Record in an optimized acoustic environment"></a>3. Record in an optimized acoustic environment</h4><p>Sometimes background noise can completely destroy the audio recording you captured. So, in order to avoid this turn off all home appliances that create atmospheric noises. In addition, the room in which you are recording should have great acoustics, because even the slightest reverb can influence the sound quality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139119/17108" target="_top" id="2139119">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139119" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139119/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Capturing-a-Video-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-4-Capturing-a-Video-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Capturing a Video Tutorial"></a>Part 4: Capturing a Video Tutorial</h2><p>Note: There are so many screen recording software available on the market as we described before. But here, we will take Filmora Scrn as an example.</p><p>Once you’ve prepared a clean working environment, attached the external microphone to your computer, it is time to start your first screencasting session.

Simply drag the Playhead to the part of the video where you want to make a cut and click on the Split icon located in the editor’s toolbar.

Speed up parts of the clip that are not important</h4><p>Time is of the essence in each video tutorial you create because the viewers might get bored if some parts of the video are too long. You can easily solve this problem by speeding up portions of the video that don’t contain vital information. Just click on the clip on the timeline to select it and head over to the Transform menu on the right side of the Filmora Scrn’s editor.

Where to upload a video tutorial?"></a>1. Where to upload a video tutorial?</h4><p>The most obvious choice is YouTube because it is the world’s largest video sharing platform. However, options such as Vimeo or even Facebook may produce equally impressive results. The eLearning websites, like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Udemy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or <a class="link"   href="https://www.skillshare.com/" >Skillshare <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are also worth considering if your plan is to produce video tutorials on a professional level.</p><h4 id="2-Optimize-the-video-description"><a href="#2-Optimize-the-video-description" class="headerlink" title="2. Optimize the video description"></a>2. Optimize the video description</h4><p>Using keywords in the video description will secure better search results. Choose keywords that are directly related to the topic your video is covering, because you will gain nothing if the video appears in search results for unrelated subjects. There are a lot of different tools online you can use to discover the best keywords for your video tutorials, including the Google AdWords Keyword Planner Tool.</p><h4 id="3-Write-a-related-blog-post"><a href="#3-Write-a-related-blog-post" class="headerlink" title="3. Write a related blog post"></a>3. Write a related blog post</h4><p>One of the best ways to promote your video tutorials is to write blogs about the topics you are covering because you can use the videos to offer more info about the subject. That way you’ll direct readers towards the tutorial and you’ll be able to generate more traffic.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Summarize-and-Improve-for-Next-Video-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-7-Summarize-and-Improve-for-Next-Video-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: Summarize and Improve for Next Video Tutorial"></a>Part 7: Summarize and Improve for Next Video Tutorial</h2><p>Don’t expect your first video tutorial to be a major success, that’s going to attract millions of views. But what you can do is keep track of the number of hits the video got, pay attention to the comments, suggestions or critique and try to do better in the next video. There are many different tools you can use to monitor a video’s performance, including YouTube Analytics if you’re using this platform.</p><p>Developing your video making skills and using the feedback you get to increase the quality of the content you’re producing is probably the most important aspect of the entire process. Failing to find ways to improve the video tutorials you’re making may result in a low number of views and their overall poor performance on the Internet, so you should do everything in your power to constantly find new ways of reaching new audiences and delivering high-quality tutorials to your audience.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The process of creating a video tutorial is rather simple since you only have to designate the region of the screen you’d like to capture, make sure that the microphone is functioning properly and hit the record button. The Internet offers plenty of opportunities to share your work with millions of people and to help them learn new skills or solve problems that are preventing them from moving forward in their careers.

Microsoft’s PowerPoint program for Windows comes with various customization options for creating a presentation. In addition to text, you can place images, tables, charts, videos, links, and other types of content in your PowerPoint presentation to really make it pop.</p><p>There have been complaints from PowerPoint users about not being able to have direct access to the full detail of the presentation after presenting. One of the most prominent problems is that users want to jot things down, and at the same time, they want to pay full attention to the presenter especially when the presentation is on ‘how to’. There is a tendency to miss little vital information. Also, those who miss presentations on PowerPoint have no hope of getting the presentation in detail.</p><p>Fortunately, there is a solution to the problem. Recording PowerPoint as a video is possible. It is an interesting and helpful idea that could help users go over the whole presentation and get the information as though the PowerPoint presentation is still live. The only difference will be the time at which they watched the presentation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-1.jpg"                      alt="how to record a powerpoint presentation"                ></p><p>This article will:</p><ol><li>Educate you on how to record PowerPoint presentations with video and audio, in a step-by-step approach.</li><li>Show you the benefits of recording PowerPoint presentations.</li><li>Teach you the advantages and disadvantages of using PowerPoint presentations with video and audio</li><li>Recommend a third-party tool to record PowerPoint presentations.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-I-When-you-will-need-to-record-a-PowerPoint"><a href="#Part-I-When-you-will-need-to-record-a-PowerPoint" class="headerlink" title="Part I. When you will need to record a PowerPoint?"></a>Part I. When you will need to record a PowerPoint?</h2><p>There are almost 35 million PowerPoint presentations delivered daily.</p><p>PowerPoint slides are the preferred method of delivering supplementary information that enables audiences to comprehend and relate to the concepts and ideas delivered in presentations, whether in classrooms or boardrooms. Presentations can take several forms, including</p><ul><li>Training and tutorials</li><li>Business and sales presentations</li><li>Executive communications</li><li>Product demos</li><li>Educational lectures</li><li>Student assignments</li><li>And more…</li></ul><p>But after they are delivered, what happens to all of those PowerPoint slides? Depending on the content and target audience, a select few will be shared or preserved, either publicly on SlideShare or privately on SharePoint.</p><p>In most cases, PowerPoint slides on their own, without the corresponding presentation — are incomplete and don’t do the best job of communicating the concepts from the actual presentation. Those ahead of the curve should be to share and archive recordings of their full presentations.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1834903">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834903.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1834903">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1834903.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1834903%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1834903/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-II-How-to-record-a-PowerPoint-presentation-with-video-and-audio"><a href="#Part-II-How-to-record-a-PowerPoint-presentation-with-video-and-audio" class="headerlink" title="Part II.

How to record a PowerPoint presentation with video and audio</h2><p>You can record a presentation in real-time as you present, or do it in advance to leverage the flipped model or make your presentation available on-demand.</p><p>While there are several ways to record a presentation, this is one of the easiest ways to record a high-quality presentation in PowerPoint with audio and video.</p><h5 id="Step1-Prepare-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Talking-Points"><a href="#Step1-Prepare-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Talking-Points" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Prepare Your PowerPoint Slides and Talking Points"></a>Step1 Prepare Your PowerPoint Slides and Talking Points</h5><p>Before recording your presentation, ensure your slides are organized correctly and error-free. The function of your PowerPoint presentation is to act as a visual aid for the information you’re presenting, not to present all your information for you. Don’t put too much info on your slides so you won’t be tempted to read directly from them.</p><p>The image below shows how your screen will look when your presentation is ready.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-2.jpg"                      alt="prepare your powerpoint slides and talking points"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Select-Your-Audio-and-Video-Sources"><a href="#Step2-Select-Your-Audio-and-Video-Sources" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Select Your Audio and Video Sources"></a>Step2 Select Your Audio and Video Sources</h5><p>You can record video, audio, or just your slide show directly within the Microsoft PowerPoint program.
